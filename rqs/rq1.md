# Research Question 1

#### To what extent are specific kinds of user feedback connected with app rating?

In this research question we want to understand which are the main topics discussed amongst users and investigate the co-occurrence between particular topics discussed in reviews and the rating of the app.

#### Distribution of Feedback

To improve our analysis we also analyzed the distribution of the various combination of _intention_ and _topic_ occurring in both low and high rated reviews. 

The following graph reports such data for all the apps available, without any distinction.

[Here](https://github.com/sealuzh/user-satisfaction/blob/master/rqs/topic.md) it is possible to see the same analysis repeated for each category.
