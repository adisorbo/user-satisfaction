# Research Question 3

#### To what extent might code quality inuence (or be influenced by) user experience?

This research question is aimed at studying the extent to which code quality can be perceived by users in their comments. Our aim is to establish if an higher frequency of certain kind of feedback in the app store could be connected to factors indicating a lower/higher code quality.

Below we report the maps for the overall correlations.

At [this](pd.md) it is possible to observe the same analysis for every category about the Problem Discovery reviews. Similarly, at [this](fr.md) we report the same for the Feature Request reviews.
