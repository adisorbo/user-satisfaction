I wish it worked in the Google Launcher on KitKat and Lollipop. I wish it worked consistently on Lollipop (the rounded corners come and go seemingly randomly). I realize that it can't be applied to the status bar  but if it at least worked on the bottom corners I think the GEL would look better. Also if the rounding could be applied to popup boxes  such as the app drawer  that would be a great enhancement. Overall 4/5 stars!,December 05 2014,4,64

Really improves the aesthetics without getting in the way  and it doesn't apply the effect to the nav and notification bars or on your home screen. Doesn't look as good if you match your notification color to your applications though.,July 22 2014,5,64

Google  our evil overlords  have deemed it fit to deprive us of such a luxury and thus have completery removed the hidden night mode from the latest beta. :(,October 20 2016,5,197

This app works as intended: enables access to Night Mode (blue light filter) setting in Quick Settings shade on Nougat. Night Mode here is a OS feature (deliberately hidden in Android 7.0 because it's half-working)  not something implemented by this app. So if you run into a Night Mode bug please don't complaining about it in this app's reviews section.,October 19 2016,5,197

Google might have its reasons of not giving out a half baked night mode feature  but then that means some body did not consider us night creatures. SHAME!!

7c49c2f3-afc9-11e6-b625-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Thank yo so much! The best app around the block if you're using a stock Android phone. Works smoothly and easy to apply process. Redicoulously mocking. A request to please add on dark mode too for Nexus devices  which used to be on the development preview of Android N (nougat) but went dead off in the main Update features..,September 01 2016,5,197
7c49c39c-afc9-11e6-9b6f-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,So glad this works I was so disappointed when I heard night mode had been dropped from the dev preview. I hate having to use third party apps for night mode but then I got nougat and this app enabled the hidden built-in night mode  both automatic and toggle options work great.,September 01 2016,5,197

7c49c523-afc9-11e6-9113-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Works Perfectly! I lost Night Mode on my Nexus 5X because once the preview build was updated to final Android 7.0 I factory reset the phone. This app made it show right back up for me. I was even able to uninstall this app after hitting enable. I decided to donate a dollar to the developer because this was a life saver for me. The night mode was the best new feature in the preview  and I really started to rely on it.,August 31 2016,5,197
7c49c5a3-afc9-11e6-8f90-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Great app It does what it says on the tin  can't ask for much more than that. If your having trouble getting it to start like I did  restart your phone and run the app again.,August 31 2016,5,197

7c49c838-afc9-11e6-96ce-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,As others mentioned  took me a few times toggling on/off to get it to work  but works great now  thanks.,August 30 2016,5,197
7c49c98c-afc9-11e6-8d17-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Excellent The automatic feature doesn't seem to always work. I still can't figure out what makes it buggy. I'm not sure if rebooting the phone makes it work better or messes it up,August 30 2016,5,197
7c49ca0c-afc9-11e6-afd9-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,One thing that seems to be missing from this is the option for use dark theme for android os. I know this is in some versions of nougat.,August 30 2016,4,197
7c49cb11-afc9-11e6-9a24-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Good App  But Auto On & Off Not Working The automatic on & off stopped working shortly after I installed this app.,August 30 2016,4,197
7c49cb9e-afc9-11e6-bf29-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Love the feature in 7.0 Loved the feature in 7.0 not sure why it was removed  but this makes it dead simple to bring back!,August 30 2016,5,197

7c49cd23-afc9-11e6-95c4-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Works exactly as advertised but It doesn't dim the light enough for my needs like Twilight does. Don't know if it's something developer can change or if it's android night mode limitation. But thks for the easy set up  it's a really cool feature,August 30 2016,4,197
7c49cd9c-afc9-11e6-9581-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Thank you. Works great on my Nexus 9. Definitely will be downloading again once the OTA hits my 6P.,August 30 2016,5,197

7c49cf21-afc9-11e6-8c7d-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Toggle and Auto Both Work This tool works exactly as described. After following the instructions  it enables the night mode options in the system UI tuner and displays the quick settings toggle. Also  despite what others have said  the automatic function within night mode works too. I had to restart my phone for this though. Also  if you're used to Twilight  you may think the automatic isn't working because it comes on much later than the Twilight default... And Google has not provided the option to adjust the timing (or the colour),August 29 2016,5,197
7c49cfa3-afc9-11e6-8cd2-c4b301cdf627,org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,I had no idea Android 7.0 had a Night Mode until I came across a comment in /r/Nexus5x that mentioned it casually  and then I found this through a Google search. So glad I did!,August 29 2016,5,197

I love this launcher because its official and everything  but the authentic trebuchet launcher has more features. I'm not knocking this or anything  hence the 5 stars; I love this idea  but it's not the real thing. I do however like that you've brought the uniqueness of trebuchet to Google play in a non-sketchy download  so thank you.,September 30 2016,5,374

7c88418a-afc9-11e6-adf6-c4b301cdf627,com.kaneoriley.cyanogenport.launcher3,Love it  keep up the good work! There is enough customization for me. The biggest reason I use this is the alphabetical vertical app menu. Changed from cyanogenmod to Lg G5's stock  needed something similiar. Only thing there is - sometimes when some application updates  it gets another icon in my app menu  its like two shortcuts next to each other. Pressing the wrong one just tells that the app isnt installed. To fix this  I have to delete data/cache of this launcher  but then I lose settings. Any fix for that? Still  Thanks for the work,September 21 2016,5,374

7cab9373-afc9-11e6-ae48-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Seriously. This is amazing  the best part is the fact that plugins can add new sources. This plus the reddit plugin for this (which can pull images from subreddits  such as nature or space pictures) makes it the ultimate wallpaper app. The blur is a wonderful subtle touch that makes any wallpaper work without making text on your screen (like transparent widgets such as DashClock -- also from the same dev) unreadable. Keep up the great work! Apps like these set standards for future Android Apps.,November 16 2016,5,609

This is my go-to wallpaper app. I am wondering if the dev could add a setting to decide if the wallpaper chosen can be shown in full rather than the zoom currently. Its not easy to explain  but the photos coming in from Reddit are high resolution and muzei shows pixels at 1:1 with phone resolution. Would like option to zoom out or show the whole image?

Previous review: This is a nice app and the blurring of images makes for effective and aesthetically pleasing backgrounds. A feature I would like  that doesn't seem to be available  is to simply pick a folder (or  better yet  multiple folders) on my device/SD card and have the app randomly select images stored within.,June 03 2015,4,609

Which gives me strange wallpaper every time I turn wifi on  this is good  though occasionally inapropriate :) The only problem I have with it  is that the same wallpaper is often repeated if you try to force update the wallpaper  to get past some NSFW material that occasionally pops up. Great App though. Recommended.,June 02 2015,5,609

7cae72b8-afc9-11e6-a989-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Nice but can be improved Nice app but UI design is confusing (why is advanced on top??). Also wallpaper often does not change even when I set to change every 3 hours. Lastly it would be nice if you could add an option to assign one wallpaper to a timeslot. I have 8 wallpapers and would like to change like this: 6:00-9:00  9:00-12:00...,February 24 2015,4,609

7cae7830-afc9-11e6-b37b-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Wear support less than hoped First of all  I've been on Muzei already. I was excited to get the wear device I just bought integrated with my phone's wallpaper  but couldn't find it anywhere. Reinstalling the app solved that problem  but there's still no customization - the settings on the blur  gray  etc don't carry over  and there's no battery meter or control of the ambient mode (which is just the time in the top right corner).,February 21 2015,4,609

7cae8c11-afc9-11e6-8d32-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Best wallpaper app I love this app. I really enjoyed the artwork but I have switched to using my own photos now. Getting a surprise wallpaper is so enjoyable. And the best part is that I can set personal family photos  but  due to the tasteful blur  no one else can really see them unless they know to double tap. So  I get to look at changing personal family photos every time I use my phone  but I don't have to worry about strangers or coworkers seeing family every time I use my phone in public. 5 stars. Best app on my phone.,February 08 2015,5,609

Thanks Roman. Would it not be easier for the default to be focussed and peeps can then blur it if they want? Don't quite know why they would want to  but appreciate different strokes for different folks. Thanks again. P.s. could you make it storable on SD card rather than internal memory  as when peeps internal phones become full they may have to lose this App.,February 08 2015,5,609

7cae90eb-afc9-11e6-8b34-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,Great app  but what happened with the wallpaper scrolling? This is a pretty cool app I use exclusively with Nova Launcher and Muzei Reddit wallpapers on my HTC One M7  just for wallpaper scrolling. A few months ago before an update  landscape wallpapers were able to fit onto the screen without having to crop out portions of the image on the left and right edges. App is really good  but seeing how a majority of the wallpapers from my favorite subreddit can't be viewed as a full picture when scrolling anymore unfortunately makes me like this app a little less.,February 05 2015,4,609

Using a mix of Tasker  Media Utilities  and plugins for Taskei  Bing  and Music I now have a wallpaper that automatically updates with currently playing cover art  and switches back to Bing's daily image if not!

Cycle multiple images on regular intervals  blur and dim images to help see icons on launcher  rotates images if launcher can support it  and handles images of different sizes. Now the BAD  this app use to show the whole image and would adjust scrolling depending on the image size in landscape but now it won't go to the edges. Also the double tap feature is broken on Smart Launcher. Although I think this is the Launcher's fault.,January 17 2015,4,609
7caeb9c0-afc9-11e6-a9a2-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.muzei,wonderful app  but how about...? making the archive a little easier to view and use? I can never see whatever it was that I had on my screen previously  even the very day before  for instance. It would sure be nice to be able to go back  look up the artist in question  save and reuse favorite backgrounds  send them to friends. One of the great things about Muzei is the wide array of artists used...not just Monet and Rembrandt...but if we lose them each day  never to be seen again  that's a pity. I can't even use the archive via the web...it's all blank! Thanks  and keep up the great work.,January 16 2015,4,609

There's one thing in this latest update that bugs me though - the alignment of artwork (at least using GPE launcher) is off  with artwork being cut off on either side. Before  the picture would align to the right absolutely  but now there's a buffer space no matter how many screens you have on your home screen.

The double-tap to bring into focus conflicts with the LG G3's tap-to-lock feature  you must double-tap near the home page dots in the lower portion of the screen to get that to work. The app is a little unstable  which is probably exacerbated by my often rubbish network reception.,September 24 2014,4,609

7c562178-afc9-11e6-93a5-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Classy - but not secure Battery friendly and simple. This is ideal if you're looking to keep your phone looking light and modern. Kudos to the devs. Edit : Hope the devs will address this problem. As of late the Lock screen doesn't turn off if I get a notification. I've set it to turn off five seconds after I get a notification but it doesn't. It will show the display and time without switching off which can be quite annoying when youre in bed and get a notification that makes the display light up all night.,June 24 2016,5,863

7c565bde-afc9-11e6-b5ce-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Very good  but a work in progress. The settings and features in AcDisplay are adequate  or more than enough for many users. However  the lockscreen beta feature needs a lot of work (I've sent an email regarding some possible fixes). The app itself is basic  and allows everyone to get the most out of it  while it's functions are very aesthetically pleasing. Also  there is a very short delay between the lock screen activating and the screen turning off  which might be noticed by a few people  although most wouldn't figure it out very quickly.,May 29 2016,5,863

7c56b1f5-afc9-11e6-a72d-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,AcDisplay brings the Active Display mode from Moto devices in a free open source app. The basic feature of this app allows the device's screen to turn when a notification appears and to quickly and easily interact with the notifications. There are 2 other options as well  making this app serve as a lock screen and/or turn on the screen based on device sensors. The overall design is very much minimalistic with a great looking design  and there are also plenty of settings to customize to fit your liking. AcDisplay is great for those wanting to view notifications quickly with a minimal and usable design.,April 23 2016,5,863

After all  it's a lock screen  so it is pretty ironic for a lock screen to not have a security. Also hopefully more customizable  like being able to change your wallpaper. Also the notification bar shouldn't be able to go down while in the lockscreen. Those are my suggestions.,April 20 2016,5,863

7c56c2cc-afc9-11e6-a339-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Great but with its downsides (bugs) Awesome lockscreen for seeing and handling notifications. My favorite feature is that I can swipe from anywhere in any direction to unlock.

There needs to be a way to swipe the media player out of the way to access the normal acdisplay screen. There also needs to be an addition that brings up acdisplay when the phone is picked up after sitting for a set period of time. I have issues with the proximity wake but pulling it out of my pocket always seems to work. Otherwise this is a fantastic app!,April 01 2016,4,863

When you tweak the settings right  acdisplay is a beautiful and useful lock screen. The primary annoyance is that you still have to go through the built-in lock screen which means multiple layers to unlock the phone. But there's probably nothing to be done about that.,March 17 2016,5,863

7c570e61-afc9-11e6-9eb8-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Pretty great lockscreen replacement for AMOLED screens—especially on a Samsung (because their lockscreen is clunky garbage). There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement  IMO  such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space  why limit it?)  allowing widgets to be wider (again  the space is there  why the limit?)  being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock  and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly  an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.,March 17 2016,4,863

7c571951-afc9-11e6-94cd-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Great app so far  similar to the features on the droid turbo I used to have. I wish you could wave your hand for showing notifications. I'll give a more in depth review after a little more time is put in.,March 14 2016,4,863

7c571d26-afc9-11e6-ac16-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Awesome app This app is wonderful. It's simple  attractive and very functional. I love the way the glimpse of your notification appears when you touch on the icon and vanishes when you take your finger away. Then darkens to remind you it had already been checked but doesn't disappear entirely until you actually check it.,March 13 2016,5,863
7c571da8-afc9-11e6-aabf-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,This is a must have Just what I need  simple  easy  light  and nice ui design. Really love it,March 13 2016,5,863

7c571fa6-afc9-11e6-b0dd-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Minimalistic - but not perfect. Ac display is fantastic and goes extremely well with my launcher on my LG Leon. But every app can be improved. Some improvements that I'd recommend is attempting to remove the constant ac bar notification. Annoying for some android users but nothing too major. Last but not least  I really hope to see different security locks like  a pin number  enter a pattern or swipe to unlock. That has been a very wanted feature with this app and I hope the devs/dev add this in a future update  but for right now. Great,March 12 2016,4,863
7c572033-afc9-11e6-a1e5-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Great app! just wondering if you could implement an 'always on' display that uses low battery for AMOLED display users,March 12 2016,5,863
7c5720a8-afc9-11e6-89ac-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Please consider adding two options - make the proximity sensor time shorter so i can basically wave over my phone for a second to see the time/notifications.. or allow always-on mode.. thank you  great work,March 12 2016,4,863

7c5725fa-afc9-11e6-bec8-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Love it. But please add a feature of locking device by pattern or pin. Because once we get notification   we have to unlock acdisplay and then phone pattern. This is quite annoying. So it'd be better if you guys provide pattern or pin lock. Awesome work at last.,March 11 2016,4,863
7c572700-afc9-11e6-aafb-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Please add the always on option It will be awesome it you add the always on display feature like s7. And option to add more than 1 widget on the screen. Maybe a pro version for these features. Thanks,March 11 2016,4,863

7c573bc5-afc9-11e6-a533-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Makes for a nice lock screen I know this application is all really about handling notifications and the lock screen is more of a side feature  but that's how I use it. The interface is very clean and simple but can also be customized with widgets. Corners can be assigned for phone or camera. It'd be nice to be able to launch any program. I love that you can interact with the normal android notification pull down while the screen is locked  to toggle the ringer or wifi. Memory usage is good  CPU is nil. Great job!,March 05 2016,5,863

7c5744f5-afc9-11e6-8367-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,I've been using it for quite a while and love it. Only complaints are with lollipop's new lock screen (wish it could go straight to pattern lock rather than slide) The design is elegant and a beautiful way of showing notifications  much cleaner than the lollipop notifications. There is one thing I'd love to have implemented: music control. Would it be possible for you to choose to play/pause/fwd/back depending on what controls are in the notification? Edit: holy crap thank you!! He listened! Edit: Podcast addict does not seem to have playback control. not sure if this is a fix on the display side.,March 03 2016,5,863

7c575cc7-afc9-11e6-95f8-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Absolutely Amazing The active notifications are simply ingenious. Touch the icon and you can preview the notification. It works with every app I receive notifications on. (Facebook  my texting app  WhatsApp) I love that I can pull my phone out of my Otterbox and the screen wakes up. Also  it'll wake the screen up if I lift my phone off of the table. The sweetest feature to AC Display is the widget integration. I like customizing my phone and being I can use KWGT to make a custom lockscreen it solves my custom needs.,February 24 2016,5,863

I'd gladly give 5 stars as I'm sure a lot of hard work goes into this app  but functionality seems diminished by my finger print security requirements. If I want to use Nexus Imprint then I am required to use a lock screen that employs added security PIN or pattern.

7c58ed99-afc9-11e6-b628-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,On LGG4 w/Lollipop 5.1. It has a lot of potential. Like others  I've found several bugs that compromise security. I am sure developer will update soon. One recommendation: it would be great if the lockscreen option would actually lock phone after a set lock timer  then a numerical code  pattern code or tap code (LG G4) could be used to unlock after swiping the AcDisplay screen. For periods of time under the lock timer  the screen would simply timeout and as usual and user would be able to wake the phone by swiping on the AcDisplay screen.,October 19 2015,4,863

7cb1f8fd-afc9-11e6-a4e0-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.dashclock,I love this app! I have used this for a long time now  but one thing I wish they would add is the option to have either an outline or dropshadow on the characters in your dashclock  because I love the simple white clock widget look  but on some backgrounds it is unreadable  and I don't like the look of the black option  or the option that has a background on the widget! So please consider either a black outline option  or a bit of a dropshadow option. Thanks!,October 09 2015,5,1331

7cb3849e-afc9-11e6-8417-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.dashclock,Simply wonderful! I downloaded this recently to spruce up the home screen on my Nexus 4. At default  it looks identical to the stock clock widget on KitKat 4.4.4  but it has additional appearance settings  and also the much needed transparency setting which allow this to be better integrated with lighter coloured wallpapers.

Unfortunately on the S4/Note etc  Samsung ?stupidly? decided that you can't have a secured lock screen while having your own personal widgets like this. So you either have an unsecured lock which allows for widgets  easy camera access  or a secured lock which only allows for their boring clock and stupid/useless personal message crap? Why? Google has already designed lock screen widgets to work perfectly with a secure lock Samsung. This is why people like your phones but not your software.,August 16 2014,5,1331

7cb504a3-afc9-11e6-a50c-c4b301cdf627,net.nurik.roman.dashclock,THIS WORKS WITH LOCK SCREEN! I have to write a positive review in defense of this app. If you are into customizing your phone this app will work perfectly even on a non rooted galaxy s4 or like phone. Using this app in conjunction with say widgetlocker allows you to get the benefits of dash clock while keeping your stock lock screen on. So stop saying this won't work with a lock screen... It will if you understand android and enjoy customizing your experience. This actually is a great app that works very well.,April 06 2014,5,1331

7c61c17a-afc9-11e6-b571-c4b301cdf627,com.numix.icons_circle,Not working correctly since update Hi Numix. Looks like suddenly icons are strange colors and shapes. Really not a fan of the pink.

7c61c817-afc9-11e6-bae8-c4b301cdf627,com.numix.icons_circle,Really great icon pack! Everything's sorted out except for the fact that a custom style applied to the theme appears to break / prevent some apps from loading. One example is Feedly.

7c61d28f-afc9-11e6-a800-c4b301cdf627,com.numix.icons_circle,Updated: Should use dominant color rather than random Update: Thanks for the reply. That makes sense. Revising my rating to be based on what you can achieve given these launcher limitations. Would be nice to have an alternate set of Numix icons with the previous white borders. .................................. Original review: A lot of my icons now have completely random colours  like green for a black and blue icon. The previous version's white/grayscale at least kept the app icons recognizable. Now the colours are totally misleading. Why would you show random colours? Why not pick the most dominant or averaged colour out of the original app icon?,October 10 2014,5,1761

7c61d823-afc9-11e6-95bb-c4b301cdf627,com.numix.icons_circle,Updates kind of ruined it I used to love this icon pack  it was simple and colorful. Then a month or so you introduced the white borders around apps  and now colored masks. For me the white was already a step in the wrong direction because it made the non themed apps really stick out  and the new masks amplify this to the point that it completely ruins the look for me. I know you can't please everyone  but it would be great if you could revert back to white  or even better if this was customizable through the app. Keep up great work,October 09 2014,4,1761

7c612370-afc9-11e6-8dc4-c4b301cdf627,com.numix.icons_circle,Great until masks I appreciate the concept of adding masks and forcing circles to every icon  but frankly it looks terrible with certain apps. Ones that stuck out were the Stack Exchange app  the Verge app  my launch dock and anything else that features an icon incorporating alpha. I will admit that particular apps looked relatively nice. QR code reader seemed almost native to numix  Fandango looks swanky but acceptable however these few do not outweigh the barely recognizable icons now cluttering my phone.

7c61528c-afc9-11e6-9a86-c4b301cdf627,com.numix.icons_circle,Looks almost as good as the Linux circle icons I was hoping like crazy that Numix would release circle icons for Android. I've been using their circle icon pack and Window/GTK+ theme on Linux for a long time and love what they have done with Linux theming. It's great that they have entered the Android market since the devs are very talented. To people who are saying that they are missing icons  aside from giving them time since they are always looking for more icon suggestions  if you are running a alternative launcher like Apex or Nova  you can manually change the icons that aren't changed from this app. And to the guy griping about them not making icons for Samsung's proprietary bloat software like S Note  Lol. Also  really  why would they have the Tardis wallpaper? I'm surprised they aren't getting into legal issues by showing it in a screenshot. Go bust out your Google-fu and look for it.,March 27 2015,5,1763
