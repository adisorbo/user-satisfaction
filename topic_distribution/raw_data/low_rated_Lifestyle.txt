But it has a lot of rough edges; brightness is crazy  when I slide up it increases  at the top it decreases again and sliding down decreases 10% or so and then leaves the lights at 90% brightness. The disco mode cannot be turned off  you need to kill the app to turn this mode off. When I only use 2 zones  I always have 2 times 4 zones in the app  the maximum. Color temp for white zones does not stick  can slide but it jumps back to 0. And the sideways sliding is alsof sliding the pages  I'm fighting this interface. Also had to restart my wifi box  it kinda lost it's way. And I had to kill the native app before using this one. Can't use the app as it is until I'll organize an extremely bright disco party :):) I'm dying to use this without the bugs and I am willing to pay a few bucks for it.,July 04 2015,2,1599

Their advice: try again later. Tinder wont let you use a fake FB profile anymore  hopefully they changed the previous settings which made it easy for creeps to literally stalk you on facebook.

Tinder has gone from somewhat ok to utter crap in the past year - changes to your profile either don't take effect at all or happen at random. Updating your work or school information is the most cumbersome process I've ever seen  pictures change at random and updating/swapping them is simply broken. It seems to have more paid features than ever but the quality is worse and worse. App shows more and wrong personal info to people and is simply broken!!!,January 12 2017,1,1920

However  if I'm even able to log in  which it mostly doesn't  all it does is search  does nothing at all. And yes my location settings were on and there's nothing wrong with my data connection as everything else works fine so clearly is just this app that's the problem.

It is mind-blowing to me how there is seemingly no effective preventative measure in place to at least help REDUCE the number of fakes. Instead  you have to wade through 20 clearly  obviously  not-even-trying-to-hide-it spam profiles before finding a single real one. Repeat ad nauseum. Even something as simple as messaging is bad. After a page's worth of a conversation with someone  the app started forcing the screen to bounce back up to the top after every new message. It's hard to explain in words alone how annoying that was. Thankfully it would crash every five or so messages anyway  so that I could get a break from its unbearable bugginess.

Overall  1 in every 500 profile belongs to a genuine girl. So  this service of Tinder becomes practically useless. But  I have given 2 stars because other services are even much worse. And the Tinder app itself is pretty nice. One suggestion would be to include a free public chat room  like there used to be in Yahoo messenger  5 - 10 years ago.,January 22 2017,2,1920

And I get frequent matches on other app (Truly madly) and got good friends and did casual dates too . I don't know what's wrong with Tinder but I eel it's useless. Even there are men's profile shown many times in my Searches instead of filters for only women's being already applied. Raised a complaint also but no use.

I have tried clearing the cache  installing the app  removing authorization from Facebook  even using different phone numbers to send the code to. But nothing works. It seems either Tinder has blocked my account for some reason  or its verification process is bugged. Either way  Tinder is completely unusable and inaccessible to me.

I deliberately liked some very very ugly fat girls and see if there is a match and apparently even they did not like back. For your information  I have had very fit body and amazing photos that would second 95% of profiles. I also have had tremendous success with real time meeting women and other dating websites.

App closes all the time and logs out of your FB page constantly.even reinstalling doesn't help.after you fight to get to the site itself you are faced with the raw unpleasantness that is Tinder. The app developers must not care about there users because about one in three profiles are bots  and that's not a joke. spaming the whole user interface and sending you links to sketch AF website DON'T CLICK ON THEM YOU MORONS!! ie: Michelle is student from student  Casey attends Michigan State  Lydia is New York from New York. Basically if they aren't from your local area you just know  and anything from New York is just terrible news! These are so proliferous I can only assume Tinder is making money off of it  which makes this no better than a porn site and is sad. There are really three types of people on here when you get down to it. 1st: 2/3 girls who have in there bio """"""""""""""""not here for sex"""""""""""""""" which is like when you got to a bar (lol like you've ever been out  if you're reading this and considering getting Tinder you probably have no social life  which is cool neither do I anymore) to meet girls hopefully trying for a one night stand but deep down you're holding out for something real and potentially meaningful  and then you meet these girls who are prude AF and shut you down before you even open your mouth  yeah that's Tinder for you  right there. PS: most of these girls are not even that attractive they just want to crush a man so they can feel like they are seriously all the hot chicks migrated somewhere else  called real life! 2nd:1/3 semi attractive women who only use Tinder to grow there social media following  which let's be honest is pretty smart... I you don't want a bunch of horny guys posting sh!t you don't want have public all the time  then maybe reconsider that option and grow it organically 3rd: 0.001% users  are like me who are normal people not like the rest of these weirdos (seriously weird people on here check out reddit pages of this stuff it's hilarious) who admit they don't have time for a social life but wouldn't mind getting dinner sometime  watching some Netflix on the weekend  but since that is literally to much to ask for we are relegated to what ever this mess of an application is. Sorry if you work hard and were looking for an easy way to meet cute real people that's too hard for the internet to provide...Snif (single tear) PS: bumble is the worst idea ever conceived  girls will never have the balls to message first and if they did you are into some weird stuff and shouldn't be surprised by what you find.""""",January 30 2017,1,1920

Dates were listed on a person's last use (to spare wasting your effort on long time inactive users)  and as a male  I would receive quite exciting numbers of matches each day with an unpaid account. My routine was to have a new date every week  and it was exciting. A relationship formed (which no longer is) which resulted in me uninstalling  and during that time a new algorithm was introduced. Since the introduction of the boost function and the new elo rating algorithm  I've seen a tenfold drop in daily matches. I was concerned it was just me  but ask any non paying male member and you'll hear the same thing. Tinder is essentially creating insecurity in """"""""""""""""veteran"""""""""""""""" users and exploiting that fear by showing the solutions that can be remedied by boosts and plus accounts ($$$). Watch a person buy a boost for the first time. The matches will rain heavily. The new tinder algorithm is money hungry. Try other apps.""""",January 30 2017,1,1920

428bceb7-f33a-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,The sheer number of fake users makes the app effectively unusable. In any major metropolitan area  I'd estimate 80% of users are fake  and you can tell simply by the similarities shared by all the scammers. Tinder clearly has no interest in policing this  as it's only gotten worse over time. Presumably they don't police this because it makes it look (to rubes) like there's tons of super attractive users. Bumble does not have this problem AT ALL so clearly it is solvable. Tinder just doesn't care. Useless app in its present state.,February 09 2017,1,1920

46fc4840-f33a-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Well this app is more like a game than a dating app  you won't known when people are online  you won't get any type of responses and if you do you'll be having those awkward talks. What it really bothers me is that you can't known when people are online  it doesn't give you the option to it. This app will be much more fun and active if you had an option where you see who are people online  and chat with them of course.,February 09 2017,2,1920

4aa79d06-f33a-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,At one time Tinder was an excellent app. A person could get many matches and it was a genuinely great advancement to the world of online dating. Then the developers decided to make some money due to popularity  which is fine. The problems with this lies with the fact that they got greedy by limiting the amount of right swipes you're now allowed  which is a pathetic number. The monthly pricing is completely out to lunch. I am recommending that people instead download the Bumble app  you get unlimited matches with a platform that rarely glitches out  unlike Tinder. The folks at Tinder should be ashamed for becoming greedy  it's a slap in the face to the early users who made the app as popular as it is.,February 09 2017,2,1920

It will say there no more people in your area when there are. For example. Yesterday I saw a girl I wanted to swipe right on. I had no likes. I waited till the next day. Swiped a few times until it said  """"no more people in my area"""". Yet I never even re-encountered that girl. This happens ALOT so ik its not the slight chance they deleted there account. I noticed if it says no more people. And if i increase my distance from 50 to 100. Let it load. Then revert it back. More users magically pop up within 50 miles. So something is up. And i find it odd that it still hasn't been fixed.",February 15 2017,2,1920

afdbd54c-f4b0-11e6-8dd5-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Tinder is showing that I've got 179 unread messages in the list of lots of matches. Well I've read all of them  just haven't replied to any and after recent log out and log in they appear as unread. Would be nice to display unread messages only instead of searching for them one by one so I can reply to them. How come you've never added a simple scrollbar? Going through the matches is a pain! Edit: Two months after I've left my comment  lots of updates but nothing much really changed. Oh  wait... I've lost 100 matches and old ones are reappearing as new ones. Plus I'm keep on seeing same girl every day for over a week even after swiping in her. Also  I just wanted to read one profile but after tapping on it  I have a Super Like instead.

Nope.Memory leaks  crashes  infinate loops  slow responsiveness. I have never had an application software on my phone that has totally crashed so often.

9de1bc2b-f711-11e6-a07d-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,We all have a duty to rate tinder badly until the tinder team take our money and start using it to make messaging fast  and a non crashing app. The only reason this app is good is because it has a large user base. It would be useful to be able to search matches to see who is nearby now! Not just for new people.,February 18 2017,1,1920
9f041c1d-f711-11e6-a07d-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I'm genuinely unimpressed. It's very buggy and often times crashes. Messaging is horrible and spastic. It's full of obviously scam/fake accounts and I'm not even sure the matching works all that well. I feel as though I'd get more matches living in a metropolitan area of over 6 million people  but it's essentially a ghost town; seems as though something is wrong because that just doesn't make much sense to me. I wouldn't recommend downloading it unless you wanna kill some looking at attractive people.,February 18 2017,2,1920

a3e001a6-f711-11e6-a07d-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,It feeds you people you've already matched with. Another thing is even if you pay they only let you see a small percentage of who's in your area on an attempt to make you use the app longer. I wish paying prevented their bottlenecking.
