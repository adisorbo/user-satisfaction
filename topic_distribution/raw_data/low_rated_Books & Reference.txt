I should be able to simply put the books into the FBReader directory on my Google Drive and have them appear in the app. NOPE I tried opening the books in the PC version in hopes that they would sync to Google Drive...NOPE. Uninstalling this app & trying something else...maybe just use Calibre to convert files to mobi & read them in my Kindle app. When I try to open a file on the PC  the search path defaults to a sub-directory of My Documents & I can't change that path even though I store this kind of content elsewhere on my computer (external drive). It's probably possible to do what I want with this app  but I have limited patience when the learning curve is this steep.

The latest version looks great with material design layouts but seems to give less information. Many things are just not accessible. The play logging is great but currently does not work since you can move to the next field.

7ccd726e-afc9-11e6-876f-c4b301cdf627,org.kiwix.kiwixmobile,The entire functionality of the Kiwix app relies on the ability to load external files (in .zim format) that you download separately. As such  you would think that the app would give you the ability to select a .zim file to load  but the app completely lacks any file selection dialog. I've downloaded multiple .zim files to try  but I can't select any of them in the app  so the app is essentially functionless. EDIT: Your response that you're surprised that search failed  and the solution to is to search again  complete ignores the actual problem. I don't NEED to search at all. I know where the file is.

But it does go with the simple look of the app. And I don't mean simple in a good way. Cheap looking for be another. If money is needed a paid version could be offered. Or if you don't want to see ads you could pay some money. This looks like something that's from the first generation devices and just stayed the same all these years.
