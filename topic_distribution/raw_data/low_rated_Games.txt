I enjoy this game  I don't enjoy dying after ninety minutes in a good game. Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things. Keep up the good work on adding things just don't forget the main priority is to have it function well. I am a person who likes to donate yet I do not appreciate improvements when known problems exist  it just compounds the issue and it is the reason software such as Windows exists with great feature bloat and so many bugs the average user is always upset about something.,August 11 2015,1,299

It gives you no direction on how to survive and too much kills you too quickly. Food is much too scarce for how quickly you begin to starve. I usually ended up using all my food by floor 2 and then I was starving again with no food by floor 3. Enemies deal way too much for how far in between healing items are.

At first Pixel Dungeon looks like a more modern version of dungeon cralwers of the past  but it suffers just like a large amount of them did from random combat  unintuitive game mechanics(potion making comes to mind)  and lots of instant death frustration.

All items you pick up are unidentified the first time you see them yet you don't get enough ways to identify them short of using them and hoping.

That's the downside: the up side is that it DOES have a good quest system and a decent battle system to boot. The movement controls however need some tweeking.

Armor is now basically useless  with the first boss consistently doing 12+ damage in one hit through a leather+1 armor. Rats and flies can tear you to pieces since it's not uncommon to roll 0 in armor - the odds are very much against the player.

However  now I think I should uninstall and remove this now falling downhill app from my game. I think with the """"balancing"""" updates now the original game would be easier than this senseless RNG (24 weapons!) drivel.

7bd2d84a-afc9-11e6-8969-c4b301cdf627,com.sam.hex,Great game with a few app problems The game is actually fantastic  however  I have been running into some issues since the UI update (sometime around summer 2013). Leaving the game and going back to it will often cause the app to open up as just a white screen. Going back from that to the home screen will (after a few times) eventually cause the app to close and be able to be re-opened to the start screen with the game lost. I'm still glad to have the app on android  and everything is great when the error does not happen  but it does end up being pretty crippling when it does.,February 25 2014,2,1258

7cbb5528-afc9-11e6-a534-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Didn't like it very much. Seems to be an Okay emulator. The options and layout leave a lot to be desired though in my opinion  app needs to be simpler and going back and fro while searching for ROMs needs to be pleasant. For some reason it wont detect ROMs stored in any other folder but Downloads. Another negative is it heavily lags on games like Pok?mon (~20-25fps Lowest settings) while Drastic handles the games just fine. However its free and based on desmume so thats nice. Compatibility with desmume on PC is priceless!,April 18 2016,2,1468

7cbcb033-afc9-11e6-8687-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Go Buy DrasticDS This is pointless and not even supported anymore because the developer knew he wasn't going to start from scratch to get it running up to full speed. DrasticDS is written from scratch from the ground up to natively work with Android devices  that's why it's full speed and you can even enhance the graphical settings. It even runs on my old 1 core cheapo Android phone that I have as a backup. Save yourself the trouble and do not download this. It is not being developed anymore anyways.,January 03 2016,1,1468
