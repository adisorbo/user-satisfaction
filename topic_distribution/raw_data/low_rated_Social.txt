The improved admin is lacking in functionally. And lately the entire system has had issues on the desktop and app. Updating categories often gives an error that it doesn't exist yet it updates if you do a series of steps. It's kludgy at best and badly designed. It is easier to go to the desktop version and work there than the app.,November 10 2016,2,545

But if I publish posts through the app the stats say no one has read it (when I know for certain people have). This leaves me with no accurate way of knowing how many people have read the post. Also if I save a draft and publish a few days later it says I published when I saved the original draft.

The interface is muddled and feels like an alpha. Going to admin is just a browser window that doesn't work as well as your browser. It has quite possibly the worst editor I've ever seen. You're better off just logging in with a browser than wasting your time on this. This is a half baked broken app. It's a good thing they don't force Android users to use the app like Evernote does  because this is atrocious. Just log in with your browser and use the web interface because its infinitely better than this.,March 30 2016,1,545

But give it about a whole minute and the rest will load. Messaging app will only show phone numbers and not the contact name. But give it a whole minute and it will. And the phone call log is slow as well. Battery drain problem as well. Android Core Apps is what it says is draining it now. Cleared cache... did nothing. Factory reset my phone.... did nothing. Updated my phone... did nothing. Finally Samsung had me put the phone in safe mode which keeps only the pre-loaded apps on it running. It works fine. Which tells me it is a problem with a downloaded app. This app is the only app i have that deals with the contacts and i will be deleting it to see if that solves my problem. I am betting it does.

931dbde0-e28b-11e6-8327-fa163e345ce9,com.snapchat.android,Ok app but it definitely needs to allow tablets and other devices to use the special filters (eg dog filter)  not just phones because people are always posting them on their phones  keep in mind not everyone uses a phone for snapchat  please find a way for thatâ˜º Also  please fix the issue where I can't take a video from the outer lens of my tablet. And a suggestion for the group chats is that it would be cool to customize it more  like the ability to choose the colour of your name and the group chat name if you havent added that already:),January 24 2017,1,1914

I do not know if you other Android  users notice  but they drop the quality of our video uploads to the Snapchat sorry board. iPhone users resolution is extremely clear. Android users  regardless of the phone model  is pixelated with some Android better than others. It still pixelated... stop making the app works best for iPhone although it's just one phone you have to focus on. We all are Snapchat users. 2. The video DOES NOT upload from camera rolls more then half the time. Sometimes it works with videos shorter then 10 seconds  but longer videos never work. 3.

f05d8b23-e887-11e6-ba6b-fa163e345ce9,com.snapchat.android,The camera/photo quality sucks in the Snapchat app. My Samsung Galaxy S7 has a great camera  which is reflected whenever I take photos outside of snapchat. While using Snapchat  however  the camera will not focus correctly  producing blurry or completely out-of-focus shots. This is a problem with Android Snapchat I have also experienced on my Sony Xperia Z2. Please fix - it's been like that for years. It's hard to like and/or respect an app completely focused around sharing photos when the app distorts the quality of the native device camera and produces extremely low-quality photos. This app when be way better I'd they would address and finally correct this problem that is not apparent on iOS.,February 01 2017,2,1914

With both front facing and normal camera view. It'd be nice if I could take normal pictures again. Since that's the entire point of snapchat. Also once the picture or video is on my story  I can't save it. At all. The button does nothing. Please fix these issues. UPDATE: Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse  it did. Now it just says """"""""""""""""Cannot refresh"""""""""""""""" and it's not my internet  not my device  just the snapchat app. At this point it's quite literally useless. Uninstalling and if I could rate it 0 stars  I would.""""",February 02 2017,1,1914

The amount of times I've heard people say androids have bad cameras because of their snapchat quality despite flagship androids having often better cameras then iPhones.

ebf7ab36-ec29-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.snapchat.android,It's a nice app. I wish that android users would get the same perks as ios user. Also  even though my camera is better than the iPhone ones  the snaps I send are always grainy or blurry. It's not user error though. My brother with an iPhone and I took a photo of the same tree in Snapchat  then in our normal cameras. In our default cameras  mine was better quality. However  in the Snapchat photos  his was better  mine reduced to a grainy mess. If picture quality matters to you  I'd advise against this. Also  the amount of storage it needs is astronomical. When you download it  it's around 61mB. It stays on your phone  and takes up 100 next time you check. Then 300. I uninstalled it at 427mB and reinstalled it at 61. Insanity.,February 05 2017,2,1914

b1da2074-ec2b-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.snapchat.android,It's real nasty that you guys check for root. I don't understand why companies have to ruin the experience of people who choose to do more with their devices. It's my business alone to root or not  and I will not unroot just to use Snapchat. Tested it with an uprooted device and it logged me in  but as soon as I tried it with my daily driver  it said that login was temporarily unavailable. I am not using anything that compromises the functionality of your app. Why should having root affect whether I can use it or not? It's ridiculous.,February 05 2017,1,1914

This functionality still doesn't work for me  but what irritates me now is that Snapchat seems to have broken the My Stories page. There is nothing there  just a button to 'Add friends'.

a26a8cf0-ef2c-11e6-9d43-fa163e345ce9,com.snapchat.android,I experienced a terrible security bug. As far as I can tell  this Snapchat application has very little password protection. I went to forgot password and typed in my email  and got it to send me an SMS verification. So it sent me it  but before i could type in the verification code  it pushed me over to change my password. My password was the successfully changed. This means that there is no security on your account. PLEASE check this over Snapchat  it's a MAJOR security hole if I'm right.,February 09 2017,1,1914

1a541320-f194-11e6-a770-fa163e345ce9,com.snapchat.android,So I had Snapchat for a few years now  and I never had a problem with its services  but now since version 3.0  I can't be able to record videos properly and also people claim to see lines when I send videos to them or to my story. Honestly I feel like your company only focus on IPhone users because whenever I look at your reviews I see the same problems with people who also have Android phones. You guys really need to step you game with your Android users or else you'll be seeing a decline from the Android community using your app. I hope you guys can think about ALL your users for a change instead of the majority. Thank you.,February 12 2017,1,1914

And every time I sent a message  it got deleted. The same thing happened to other people in the same chat. Also  it's not registering when people open my messages. Another thing is the refresh feature  instead of being an instant thing  I have to constantly retry for it to refresh. And even then  it's confusing as to if it actually refreshed.

CONS: Once I hit the snap button  it'll take a second or two to register  then it'll finally capture a photo. And once it does capture a photo  all I see is a black  blue  or white image. The biggest problem I've found with Snapchat is some of my friends won't receive my snaps. It'll say it sent  but they never get it unless I send another one.

Recent story updates never show all of the people I follow (which is less than 10)  and it has nothing to do with the others not having any new stories. The number has dropped down to 2 friends' story updates. I've tried uninstalling then reinstalling. Doesn't work. And by the looks of the other reviews  this app is horrible for Android users  and a lot of us are unhappy. Not even sure Snapchat will work on fixing these issues.
