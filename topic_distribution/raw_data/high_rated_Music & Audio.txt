7bde6a02-afc9-11e6-bd97-c4b301cdf627,com.midisheetmusic,This application works as expected. There is some issues with certain midi files with improperly programmed sheet music that causes tempo to be out of range of the this app. This is not the fault of the developer. I like how it scrolls through the notes on the sheet music and also like how the virtual keyboard shows you which keys to press. Very handy little app. Kudos to the developer for making this app and it really is ad-free!!,October 29 2016,5,4

7bde6f02-afc9-11e6-8292-c4b301cdf627,com.midisheetmusic,Pretty good  great for midi notation  but still lacking in some areas... Desperately needs some more notation features  especially for triplets/duplets/sextuplets/etc. Also needs work on fixing the zoom in vertical mode  notation disappears when you zoom out.

I recommended this app to everyone who does part-singing. The option to show lyrics and measure numbers already present is a plus. My community chorus midis are notated that way. Instead of coloring the notes  the option to highlight my part by the line  like a highlighter  as well as the words  with different colors for each  would be better.,February 22 2015,5,4

It's also great for deciphering chords and rhythms. I play viola  so I'm used to playing and transposing treble clef.

Nearly perfect  but when I try to play along and the music is scrolling too fast  I have to tap the screen to stop it; and that often causes a change in the speed setting  which is infuriating -- especially since it's quite hard to set an exact speed with the slider in the first place. Can we PLEASE have the music speed as a setting in the tune properties  rather than an onscreen slider -- or the option of one or the other? Many thanks.,January 15 2015,4,4

7bdef602-afc9-11e6-b33e-c4b301cdf627,com.midisheetmusic,Terrific app! This is pretty much what I wanted in a MIDI app for learning to play piano. It allows me to import a MIDI file for a piece and then play it at different speeds  just one hand at a time  etc.  all while displaying the score and scrolling it automatically. I'd gladly pay a few bucks for it  but it's offered for free with no ads. Thank you! One suggestion: It would be nice to be able to save the tempo for a piece across sessions (right now  it seems to get reset to 100%).,July 04 2014,5,4
7bdef685-afc9-11e6-8c83-c4b301cdf627,com.midisheetmusic,Love it Just wish I could pause and rewind sections and search a large database of songs but otherwise it's awesome! Can't believe this is a free app! Now does anyone know where I can safely download some midi files?,July 02 2014,4,4

7bdefb02-afc9-11e6-8337-c4b301cdf627,com.midisheetmusic,A Great Resource ...for adult learning piano late in life. You can cut the tempo to a crawl and study how each note is played and how it sounds. Good preloaded classical selection  and when you download more MIDI files (widely available)  the program finds them and automatically loads them to the list. Great work- the man needs to be paid!,June 06 2014,5,4

7c0f5aae-afc9-11e6-aee6-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Would be perfect Superb app  but would be perfect if when you permanently cached something it didn't get deleted when you wipe the cache  so you are essentially downloading it. Or you can just add a download option.,June 16 2015,4,318
7c0f5b26-afc9-11e6-8548-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Awesome! The only issue I had so far is with aac files. Dsub doesn't seem to download the file or the download progress is wrong (always showing 100%),June 10 2015,5,318
7c0f5ba6-afc9-11e6-87d6-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Was experiencing songs skipping and choppy playback performance in Subsonic for the past year. Never noticed there were other players.

7c0f5e6e-afc9-11e6-89da-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,By FAR the best Subsonic app. Yep. Its the best... None of the annoying behavior of the other Subsonic clients. The only issue I've had is when playing certain files through ChromeCast the playback will freak out for a few seconds then skip to the next song. I'm guessing this is a problem with the ChromeCast reading my VBR encoding  not the app itself.,May 14 2015,5,318
7c0f5ef0-afc9-11e6-80f1-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,The Best streaming app ever Great work by the dev  this app just keeps getting better and it was awesome to begin with. If you have a digital collection of your music  why bother loading it on your device? Or a cloud? Use Dsub and it's all at your ear lobes instantly. Love the new icon too. Wow  now picks up where I left off when I flash new Rom! ! That's AWESOME!,May 13 2015,5,318

7c0f64de-afc9-11e6-8f1b-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Great but has a playback bug that really annoys me I love the features on this player  but there is one bug that annoys the heck out of me. Many times  when I skip to the next track on the playlist  there is no music playing even though the progress bar and time is moving along. The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode. It didn't always do this before  so I don't know what happened. I've used this player for well over a year  but this problem just started like a month or two ago. *update*: I did try reinstalling Dsub  but after reinstalling  i found that it remembered all of my settings. I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker  everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem. Possibly the player stops sending signals to the speaker in between song skips and it has trouble reinitiating when the next song starts? I can hear slight clicky sounds on the bluetooth speaker when skipping tracks.,April 09 2015,4,318
7c0f65a6-afc9-11e6-85b3-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Works with Ampache 3.8.0 Probably the most current  most complete  feature rich Subsonic/Ampache mobile app available on Android. Actively developed  regularly updated. The dev is responsive and has fixed numerous bugs I've reported even though I'm using Ampache (as long as it is relevant to Subsonic). Has even been kind enough to pass on important compatibility information for Ampache devs for better overall experience. Well worth the purchase.,April 06 2015,5,318

7c0f6c6b-afc9-11e6-8ec6-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Much better than the Subsonic app The interface is snappy  but could conform to normal music app style and navigation schemes a bit better. Easier to setup than Subsonic itself. Playback is nice. EQ is a nice feature. (Almost) gapless playback is the most important feature for me  and this app does it better than any of the others I've tried--even other streaming systems' apps. Not a five-star app  but worth the four bucks.,March 05 2015,4,318

7c0f7047-afc9-11e6-9a30-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,better than stock app but... 3.5 stars it's better than stock subsonic app. not sure that I'd buy again. lacks a critical feature that I expected. it pauses when I unplug headphones but unlike most music players it lacks option to automatically resume play when I plug headphones in again. this requires me to unlock the phone and open app to resume play. a nuisance. another nuisance: when playing  widget appears over lock screen allowing me to pause and skip tracks. nice. if I unplug headphones  widget disappears thus requiring to unlock screen.,February 10 2015,4,318

To ensure this isn't a data-at-rest issue  I've rewound to the same point in the music and the pop doesn't recur. I initially thought it might be a problem with EQ processing; but  alas  I still hear an occasional pop and buzz with EQ disabled. UPDATE- Music issue seems to be in the Android media stack.

The only problem I found was for some reason it defaults to using the external sd card storage to download music files to. This results in very large mp3 files to stutter. This is probably not a problem for most. Since my collection is primarily Grateful Dead  some songs are very long. So if you have similar problems  create folder on your device storage  then change the settings in the app. You'll be fine.,November 30 2014,4,318

Extremely impressed by this app and it's developer! ENDUPDATE. This app is easily the best Subsonic app out there but I do have one little annoying issue. I let the app decide which server address to use based on my home SSID. However I have both a 2 5 and a 5GHZ signal. Each with their own SSID. I want to be able to set them both in the SSID 'whitelist' (be it comma or backslash separated).,August 08 2014,5,318

7c0f9b0f-afc9-11e6-910d-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Reliable! My problem with the official Subsonic app was that it would restart every song after 30 seconds. Sometimes I'd be halfway through a song and it would restart. This is immediately my favorite thing about Dsub... it doesn't start the song over! It is reliable  and completely worth the money  for this reason alone.,June 12 2014,5,318

My only gripe is the lack of support for multiple tags in the same field  i.e. tags separated by some separator  for example """"jazz;free jazz;experimental"""" as the genre tag  which should result in the song being found under all of the three genres listed  or """"Sunn O)));Boris"""" as the artist field  which should result in the song (and the whole album of the song) being listed under both the artists """"Sunn O)))"""" and """"Boris"""". This is the way squeezeserver operates and really should be the standard  but I am yet to find a mobile music streaming app that allows this basic functionality. Edit: Changed the rating to 5 stars after a developer reply explaining that lack of multiple tag/tag separator issue is a limitation of the subsonic server itself and not due to app design.",June 10 2014,5,318

Different features aside  playback is smoother  caching of songs is more transparent  offline playback works better.

7c0faab8-afc9-11e6-87dc-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Chromecast support makes this a no-brainer Updated review a few years on : I've had this app through three different phones now  a Samsung Europa  a Huawei G300 and now a Moto G  and this wonderful tool has never missed a beat. It remains the best streaming app ever  meaning my CD collection now resides on my home server  and I am literally carrying every piece of music I own a few clicks away. I bought the chromecast in the UK today on debut and my love for this app has just quadrupled ! The casting support on this app is flawless  and has just rendered a piece of hardware junk (WDTV Live) obsolete. Responsive developer who continues to push the envelope,March 19 2014,5,318

I was even more impressed when the first showstopping bug I'd encountered was fixed in 24 hours. A noticeable step up from the stock Android app  and I think a little better than Ultrasonic. And really  I wouldn't be surprised if the developer would consider whatever complaints you might have,February 22 2014,5,318

I've been using DSub for a couple years now with my Subsonic server  it's easily the best Subsonic client out there in terms of configuration.

I was able to revert back to a transcoding mode and I can stream my videos again. FFMPEG revisits the beginning portions of a video stream after it is done with a transcoding  but when downloading via the cache function this is not possible as the file is on the remote end  as a result my downloaded videos are not seekable  which is a drag. Looking to see if there is any workaround to this.,February 05 2014,5,318

Dsub has all the features you didn't even know you were missing from the official subsonic app. Playing and managing podcasts  managing playlists  and casting directly to my server are some examples. Last FM top tracks  similar artists  and artist radio are also nice in helping me rediscover my library. The developer is also very responsive and always improving the app. Speaking of which  artist radio stopped working for me after last update. Using Android 7. Please fix and thanks for creating a great app.,October 04 2016,5,319

Can't display special characters such as in Beyonce  Jack U. Also when using permanent cache the songs freeze during syncing temp fix is to click the song and choose play next hit play then hit next song. It will then load. 6.0.1,September 10 2016,4,319
7c0f050f-afc9-11e6-a5a3-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,"As good as Subsonic will allow. Very nice software. But the Subsonic server (not DSub) has a few issues concerning browsing large collections: You can list 1) albums alphabetically; 2) Genres; or 3) browse the library as file structure (typically Artist\Album) or tags (Artist\Album). But  Subsonic has no handling of multiple artists or multiple genres on one album  even creating problems since semicolon """";"""" is simply omitted in artists  leading to strange artists like """"BachMozart"""" as opposed to """"Bach; Mozart""""  or one entry """"Bach"""" and another """"Mozart"""" for same album. Can be mitigated somewhat by the """"Browse by tags"""" server setting  resulting in an artist called """"Bach/Mozart"""". Likewise the genre listing suffers when the genre filed has many entries  since each combination of many genres is understood as one new unique genre  e.g. """"Jazz; Bob"""" is not the same as """"Bob; Jazz""""  nor """"Jazz""""  nor """"Bob"""". Many other databases like MediaMonkey  iTunes handles all this excellently  but not Subsonic. Conclusion is that DSub  though as excellent as it gets  is limited when navigate among your 100.000 albums/tracks. DSub still gets 5 stars. But Subsonic  please do fix this.",September 07 2016,5,319

7c0f06f8-afc9-11e6-bbf5-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,5 star app until Nougat bugs fixed.... Please update this app!!! Bugs: Dsub immediately resumes the last song when you first load the app but does not show the song as playing. Then afterwards it jumps to the next song after 20 seconds.. plays that song fully... then it's the end of the playlist. Also sometimes when i load the app it'll start playing 2 songs at once and i can only pause one. I'll have to close to entire app to get it to stop playing. App is totally unusable until this is fixed. Please fix! Edit: Thanks for being such awesome responsive devs. App is working perfectly again. Thanks!,August 31 2016,5,319

7c0f0c51-afc9-11e6-a427-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,I love this Subsonic App. The best one I've tried so far. Unfortunately  it doesn't seem to be working on Android N  but I assume it won't take long before it's fixed! <3 Edit: To clarify  the app seems to pause/unpause constantly and never plays a song  even if it has already been previously cached/downloaded.,August 22 2016,4,319
7c0f0d05-afc9-11e6-b83b-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,The app in general has been great  no crashes or anything.

7c0f0d91-afc9-11e6-86e5-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Love this app. Best Subsonic mobile client that I've found so far...but  one feature that would make this a 5-star rating is: Add a feature to browse offline files via ID3 tag (if this is possible...or let me know if I'm just overlooking something and the feature is already there) I have my music organized in various folders by genre and in certain genres that have a huge number of artists  they are organized in alphabetic sub-folders by artists name (such as A-B  C-D  E-G  etc)  and by only having option to browse offline by folder  it makes it hard to browse my downloaded songs to find what I'm in the mood to listen too unless I remember exactly what I have downloaded and exactly what I want to listen to. I prefer to use DSub  but for offline music  I currently tend to go back to Google Play Music since I can browse offline files easier by just a list of everything that is downloaded and I can scroll through everything. Thank You!,August 22 2016,4,319

7c0f0e9e-afc9-11e6-a976-c4b301cdf627,github.daneren2005.dsub,Best subsonic app but a couple things could improve it I love d sub. One issue that I'm having though is that when a folder's files have tagged titles but no track numbers it arranges according to title tag rather than the way it's organized in the file folder  in my case by filename. Even though I do have the setting to arrange by folder structure. Also  one improvement might be to have an option to automatically turn casting off when connecting to Bluetooth  I've inadvertently blasted out my family just by turning on my car.,August 16 2016,4,319

However I have an issue possibly due to my folder structure but I feel I'm not the only one that does it this way. Media sorted as Letter \ Artist \ CD \ Track  example E\Eminem\Marshal Matthers LP \01 - Intro.mp3 . Within the App I get my list of letters to choose from  when I choose this the app then seems to assume the folder E is an artist and is displaying a blurb about an artist named E. Below is not CDs but the artist names themselves. Not sure if this is something that can be fixed or adjusted but let me know. EDIT: THANKS FOR THE TIP THIS WORKS AWESOME.

Great features  excellent UI  plenty of widgets  and frequent updates by a very involved Dev. Well worth the cost  so just buy it.

Easily my favorite all-time Android app  it fulfills a dream I had years ago when I got my first high-capacity iPod -- that I'd have access to all of my personal music collection (which then was a seemingly-absurd 250 GB  and which now is closing in on 2TB)  all of the time  no matter where I am. I still wish stream-of-consciousness browsing was easier (i.e.  that you could tap on the artist name during playback  or even the song name  and have an auto-search done -- as it is  you need to back out to a search field and input your search terms manually)  but I'm so impressed with the app overall that doesn't impact my enthusiastic 5-star rating.

4e1b9c46-af52-11e6-8c10-b603b9227580,de.qspool.clementineremote,This Remote app allows people to control Clementine from their Android device. What is Clementine you might ask? It's a free and open source music player that has a great wealth of features  and is available on the 3 major OSes. Thus  you require Clementine to use the Remote  but it's well worth it since it's a fantastic music player. You can do simple tasks like control the music with this app  but there are a few more things you can do all in the Remote. You can do playlists  search your library  get song info  and even download music to your device. Clementine Remote acts as a great companion to the standard Clementine player. Clementine on its own is awesome to use  and the Remote grants extra usability from the comfort of your Android device.,November 03 2015,5,433

The app is just amazing generally  it just has a couple of quirks that happen sometimes that don't exactly ruin its functionality  but they are slightly annoying. For example  when the screen goes to sleep and I turn it on again  or if I exit the app and open it again  it will have reset to the first playlist instead of the one I'm on. It generally does that  like when browsing the library  entering a folder and then going back it starts at the top again. Otherwise perfect.,January 11 2015,5,433

7bdc4c68-afc9-11e6-a46d-c4b301cdf627,com.harleensahni.android.mbr,Great App But Have One Suggestion This is a great app. It annoys me that whenever my phone pairs with my car  it automatically starts playing my music. Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead. My suggestion is as follows  and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example  I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately  the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch  that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps. Again  great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone.,November 30 2014,4,582

Set Google as the default  and all works as expected. The other headset buttons allow me to pause  next  previous just like the standard music player does.

7beaa3f8-afc9-11e6-a788-c4b301cdf627,uk.org.ngo.squeezer,Indispensable. An upgrade The app builds on the Logitech Squeezebox interface by adding performance enhancements and an easier way to access large libraries. Searching across albums  artists  and songs is beautifully accomplished. Simplifies alarm clock management  too.,January 02 2016,5,689
7beaa482-afc9-11e6-af48-c4b301cdf627,uk.org.ngo.squeezer,Good but Good. I have only used it for a short time so far and I am already impressed with how it looks and performs. It took just a few seconds to find my server and music with no input from me. The only thing i have found disappointing is the random song play mode.

7beaacb8-afc9-11e6-81a3-c4b301cdf627,uk.org.ngo.squeezer,"Fantastic. This is what the official Logitech SB Touch app should have been. The controls are very responsive. Using the volume buttons to control the squeezebox volume is a no-brainer but why didn't Logitech app designers think of that? Just in case anyone is wondering  there's a """"download"""" option in the playlist page which you can use to copy any song in the playlist to your device (music folder). Just press the little triangle beside the song you want to copy and choose """"download"""". A widget would be a great enhancement to an already awesome app. Thanks very much for making this great app!",November 18 2015,5,689

7beab442-afc9-11e6-bac4-c4b301cdf627,uk.org.ngo.squeezer,Worked first time with no problems and quite quick to connect.

Am I missing a setting? - I couldn't find one.,October 05 2015,4,689
7beab5ab-afc9-11e6-86f8-c4b301cdf627,uk.org.ngo.squeezer,Almost perfect So far this is the best squeezebox controller I have seen. Since I end up using multiple squeezebox radios as well as squeezeplayer on old cell phones  the ability to easily control them all from one screen is nice. The only problem I have is when my phone or tablet goes to sleep after a minute of non use  the connection to the server is lost  even though it doesn't indicate it from the screen. I have to disconnect and reconnect in order to get it working again. I would like to see a widget controller.,September 21 2015,4,689

The only problem is that after about 20 or 30 tracks although it continues to show the correct track information it seems to give up on the cover art and just shows a blank icon. The app could also be improved (and would be worth paying for) if you could choose what tags to display as part of the """"now Playing"""" information. If your collection is specialist (e.g classical   jazz) it currently doesn't show the tags you want (composer  conductor etc) and there is no way to configure it to do so.",March 22 2015,4,689

It's the most compatible and accurate module player I've tried for Android  and the linear resampling is really clean and maintains the brightness. But I've also encountered some bugs in the playback engine. Some tempo changes aren't right  some notes play out of tone  the retrigger command (E9x on XM/MOD  don't remember the S3M/IT code) doesn't work  and sometimes you can hear detuned notes that shouldn't be audible.

There is really only one thing which is lacking: headset controller integration. It would be wonderful to be able to pause using the headset button  or jump forward or back in the playlist. But  even lacking that  I prefer it over the alternatives. It is that good. Edit: Thanks Claudio for asking about that. I should have been more specific above. I have not had trouble with any of the various bluetooth controllers I have used  but the conventional wired variety unfortunately do not work. I still use these often because I run down the batteries on the wireless ones. Not a big deal surely  but I note it as the only thing which wasn't perfect. A really fantastic app.,July 20 2016,5,1067

7cbe17a3-afc9-11e6-a0e5-c4b301cdf627,org.helllabs.android.xmp,Really good player This one plays my mod files flawlessly. The only cons i have found are inconsistencies with the interface (e.g. i found no way to access the current playlist if i have paused for a while and return to the app)  it does not remember my shuffle settings  and maybe the worst is huge cpu cinsumption. My phone has burnt over 20% of its battery in around half an hour for something that should be cheaper to do :). Running on SM-N900,February 25 2015,5,1067

At first I dismissed the modarchive search and download since it didn't work  but recently I found out the problem was with the location I set for my mod directory and now it works! It would be nice to have access to the genre filters to make it more useful. Of course  every time there's an update I always check if a couple of my problematic mods got fixed  but now I think I will send these in myself.,January 04 2015,5,1067

Xmp's channel view is particularly awesome; you can see the currently playing waveform for each channel and each can be singled out or muted individually (surprisingly uncommon among android chip players). The instrument names are displayed front and centre (great for those chipper's notes). The developer is great too; very responsive and accommodating. Simply fantastic,August 11 2014,5,1067

7be9f302-afc9-11e6-bf80-c4b301cdf627,naman14.timber,Still a beta and quite buggy  but beautiful. I really like Timber. It's beautiful  customisable  uses both dark and light status bar icons if your ROM supports it (Xiaomi & Huawei/Honor users (on EMUI 4) will be happy!) It's still quite buggy which reminds you it's still in a beta state. As an example when you skip a track it might still display the previous song's info  the headphones' button does not work with it... But it's still a nice player.,February 07 2016,4,1369
7be9f42e-afc9-11e6-812e-c4b301cdf627,naman14.timber,Some little bugs and design issues  great otherwise! After installing it  a now playing bar shows up at the bottom and  when touched  shows the now playing page  but blank. Also  in the now playing page  there's no difference between the repeat all and the repeat song icon. And in the first now playing layout and main screen  that animated equalizer icon gives me a feeling like the app lags  because of its low framerate. Besides that  it's an awesome app  you can even choose between multiple now playing layouts!,February 06 2016,4,1369

However there is one problem that makes me use Ultrasonic. This app prevents Google maps navigation from being heard. The media audio mutes and you hear nothing while I assume directions are given. So I find this app useless for road trips. However I keep it on my phone as I really do like the interface and layout better than the other apps I have tried. If it fixes the navigation issue it will become the only app on my phone.,January 30 2016,4,1530

Anyway thanks to the great work  Subsonic is still my favorite (best) music streamer.,January 03 2015,5,1530
7be240c7-afc9-11e6-85a6-c4b301cdf627,net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,How rude Adding ads to the app and then forcing us to pay to remove them is just rude when you consider we were told that was why we were paying for this server app in the first place. Get the DSub app instead. Not only is it cheaper to make ad free but the developer is much more responsive and the app is worlds better anyway.,December 28 2014,4,1530

7be2436e-afc9-11e6-a766-c4b301cdf627,net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,Love you long time I've used subsonic almost 5 years now. It's my life love. This app is good. I really miss the ability to specify cache location. I think this is a new android issue not allowing apps to save to SD c?rd. Silly. It would be nice if in the library section if one of the options for folder was local android files. If this was the case I would not need another music app as well. The flow and layout is great. Not a 5 star app but darn fine,November 25 2014,4,1530

7be24602-afc9-11e6-85a9-c4b301cdf627,net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,Ads help support the developer Stop whining about ads in the app. It doesn't stop you from using the app and you've been using the app ad free all these years. Yes you donated to get subsonic in the browser ad free. We get it. So if you pay for your car  do you get gas free? No. If you don't like ads  don't use the app. I don't mind the ads. I love the app and I would gladly pay to get the ads removed. Fortunately I don't mind it being there.,November 04 2014,5,1530

7be24f78-afc9-11e6-8705-c4b301cdf627,net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,Issues. I'll start off saying this app is awesome. I can stream so many files from my PC to my phone and this is fantastic. But my issues are this. The app will not exit and gives errors and force closes when trying too. It seems to not be shuffling my entire library but choosing a certain amount of songs to shuffle instead. How do I login to my account online other than my home computer? I am using a Samsung galaxy s4 with the 4.3 o.s.,September 06 2014,4,1530

7be25342-afc9-11e6-80f5-c4b301cdf627,net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,Very good audio player This is a solid player that let's you access you or a friend's music collection on the go. Many great features. My one suggestion (if I didn't just miss the feature) would be to give more control over the playback buffer. For example when a song is playing it will often pause to buffer. It would be nice to say don't start play back until 1mb or 1 minute of playback is available. There may be protocol limitations that prevent this feature  but if not that's one for my stocking this Christmas :),August 31 2014,4,1530

The problem is that browsing and searching is not that easy. Could you add a search (in artists song name album etc) at the same time? And a tabbed layout for switching between artist / songs /.. Would be cool and not by picking it from the list.. If you do this 5* for me. Currently I feel a bit handicapped. Would support you btw if you update it :),September 29 2015,4,1579
7c12bde6-afc9-11e6-bd34-c4b301cdf627,jp.co.kayo.android.localplayer,The only good Ampache client Tried the others on the play store without success but just player just works. There is a strange icon in the album art screen that looks like a world map  which crashes just player on every tap. Overall it is a great app and also looks nice. For those not able to connect  make sure you have stream access and RPC setup in your ampache admin settings before using just player.,August 28 2015,5,1579

Easy tag editing  easy multiple song selection to create playlists  and auto- generated playlists based on your song ratings! Choose the number and types of view tabs too edit/play from (folder  artist  song  etc.)  and even more  you can select the viewing style (album icons  list  artist tree  etc. Couple things - have had problems with crashing  and the web album/artist info search doesn't work (?).,March 08 2014,4,1579
7c12d4fd-afc9-11e6-b44a-c4b301cdf627,jp.co.kayo.android.localplayer,Exactly what I was looking for Really like this music player and the smooth UI. Widget is nice and clean and loving that the player supports album art which you can easily download from the web through the player itself. No lagging between songs either which amazed me when streaming over slow mobile data :) Unfortunately when streaming music from Dropbox  if the player hasn't cached the song and you try to add album art or modify the title in the library  it crashes :( Prolly need to stream all songs first and then start modifying those little details in the library.. Otherwise a really good app  smooth and clean. Hoping development continues to make this the next big music player ;),March 06 2014,4,1579

Been using it for months and it's really easy and simple to use and it also looks gorgeous! :D But I do have one feature I'd like implemented.. The option to sleep after a chapter ends.. I usually use audio books consisting of a lot of chapters in different mp3 files.. So a feature to sleep after finishing a chapter (reach the end of an mp3 file) would be very very nice to have!

I have my library organized by author  series  and then the books. I can't select a root folder to add (my master Audio Book folder)  otherwise it thinks the sub-folders are their own book. My suggestion: having it maybe show the sub-folders  and then clicking the folders shows the next folders  kind of like a music management  where you click on artist  then album and such.,April 10 2016,4,1796

Save my bluetooth headphone battery. I'm sad that Dev has rejected this feature request raised by another user.

I used to use Smart Audiobook player but I've swapped to this because it lets you search through your titles without stopping the current Audiobook. So well done Dev' & thanks.!!.,October 21 2016,5,1797
7c99ffc5-afc9-11e6-9cdd-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Does what it says on the tin. No nonsense  simple & user friendly. Great for audio books as it saves your last spot but rewinds it slightly to get you back up to speed & can add manual bookmarks. Just what I wanted. Keeps it simple. :),October 20 2016,5,1797

7c9a03ca-afc9-11e6-a95e-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Nice UI and good player overall  but doesn't handle nested folders (and ignores tags?) - it assumes all books in a folder are the same book. This doesn't work for layouts like Author\Book1 (possibly chapters in sub folders) Author\Book2 Author\Book3 etc,October 12 2016,4,1797
7c9a044c-afc9-11e6-b783-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Almost perfect My only real issue is that I can never resume playback from the same spot after a long pause. If left paused long enough  the player always jumps way back closer to the beginning of the audio file. It's always a hassle to return to where I left off  especially if I can't remember where that was.,October 11 2016,4,1797
7c9a04cf-afc9-11e6-9237-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,Great App Love the ability to set a standard sleep timer and start it with the touch of a button. But there a couple of features I'd love to see  a shake to restart the sleep timer and the ability to add books a series so that I don't have to sift through so many to find the book I'm looking for. Thanks for your work on this app,October 11 2016,5,1797

Small bug  sometimes it doesn't pause playback when a call comes through despite having that option selected. Also  doesn't play m4b format  selecting an m4b causes the app to crash.,August 24 2016,4,1797
7c9a14d1-afc9-11e6-9d3e-c4b301cdf627,de.ph1b.audiobook,So much better than all the other audio book players. Keeps getting better with each update. So glad the developer isn't adding unnecessary features. edit - Can we have the ability to play .zab and .zip. Essentially just audio files contained within an archive. Neater than having lots of folders with loose files?,August 24 2016,5,1797
