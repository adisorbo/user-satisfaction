However  it hasn't been updated in over 2 years. OpenKeychain is a fork of APG that is much more currently updated. I have switched to that system. Changing over k9mail is pretty straightforward; the crypto provider just needs to be set to OpenKeychain in each account. Don't get me wrong. I loved its seamless integration with k9mail. It's just that I need something that isn't going to be full of vulnerabilities because of simple lack of updates.

After a call has ended  the proximity sensor stays on  causing the screen to black out constantly (on my Nexus 5 w/ CM13). Also  it uses port 5060 by default even though the Random Port is selected. This causes dummy calls from malicious IP scanners to come through directly to the app  bypassing your SIP provider. It took me awhile to figure out why I was getting these calls till eventually I toggled the Random Port button off and then on again and got an actual random port. If these sorts of problems get attention from the developers  Linphone has the potential to be great  but for now  I'm back to Zoiper.,April 15 2016,2,200

This is just what I was looking for. A lot like my native app  but this allows font size changes. Each time I boot it up it lets me read but then I when I try to compose I get the """"app has to close"""" message. Have un/reinstalled. No luck. I don't need a fancy app  nor can I spare the storage. I think somebody """"up there"""" doesn't like 2.3. When this phone was 2.2 I had very little problems. I've seen discussions about Gingerbread  it's was a good step up from Froyo  but it's a little """"hinky"""" and because of it's age developer really aren't excited about servicing it.
