Then my phone kept rebooting. I'm an IT Architect  so I knew what to do. It took me a while -- a couple of weeks  of uninstalling a couple of other apps along with this one (the apps I had installed just before the phone started rebooting)  then re-installing them (over days!) and then uninstalling  and so on. As I say  that took many days  since I would have to wait for a couple of days to see if the phone would reboot or not .I finally was able to conclusively prove that it was only after I installed Vim Touch that the phone kept rebooting. I have now had it uninstalled for a couple of weeks  I've reinstalled the other apps  and my phone is not rebooting. Since it does not run all the time in the background  all I can figure is that there is something that is going haywire during the install itself  causing problems later on. File corruption? Something not being registered right? I haven't done any Android development  just UNIX and Linux (since 1980!)  so I don't know what to tell you.

Several times I had to go into /data deleting swapfiles of Vim Touch's config files. It doesn't seem to have any resilience to its own preference settings. Even if your phone is rooted  don't set Vim Touch's Root option! It will never start again so you can't switch the option off. Other pref settings and normal vim uses also do this. And oh wow: *don't* try using vim encryption. Hangs and force quits everywhere. Then it made 3 of my files become zero size. All my 40+ others apps are working fine. I can't understand the 5 stars for Vim Touch. Perhaps people are just enjoying it as a toy or a novelty.

I imagined since it was a Google App that my accounts and authenticator was syncing to Google so if I reinstalled everything would be there including the programs I was using 2-step for. I reinstalled and all is gone and a couple of programs I used cannot be recovered and are asking me to create a new account. This is upsetting. Going back to 2-step with phone.

If you do  the option to transfer your authenticator settings to your new device is not there. You have to re-enter each entry manually after you've cancelled it.

My experience was I got a new phone and had to add the accounts again to this app  they didn't carry over when I installed app on new phone for some odd reason. The problem with 1 was I needed the code from this app to be able to login to the account to get the qr or key needed to add the account again to the new phone...obviously not possible.,August 27 2016,1,789

0956227f-afda-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Ye I get it 2 factor auth is supposed to be bound to a specific device. But no backup feature means you are seriously boned if anything happens. Get Authy or Auth Plus  anything but this. Or if rooted you could use Titanium (or manually backup the App settings) but why  just why? Which brings me to another point. On a rooted device this PoS is absolutely NOT secure. The settings are not encrypted at all  they basically assume your phone is secure which Google obviously knows isn't always true  not to mention that they have no control over that. Well done Google  wanna be secure when its inconvenient for the user but too lazy to encrypt what you are trying to protect.,August 22 2016,2,789

They time out so quick copying a code should not be a multi-tap effort. Also  if an app on my device requires a code  it should get it straight from Google Authenticator in the background: I should not even have to open the app and waste time.

A 5-star security app  no doubt  but the new UI & icon are absolutely hideous lol. The bright white material design is not only hideous but it's also an unnecessary power drain on AMOLED screens!! It's bone headed decisions like this that makes people switch from Android over to Apple. So what I did was rollback to the previous version  disabled automatic updates  and detached the app from Google Play using Titanium Backup. Also made sure to create a schedule every 6 hours to keep detaching the app as a workaround for Google’s reattachment scheme.

This WAS ONCE a really good basic alarm app without unnecessary gimmicks or permissions.

This is a FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM  because an alarm must be 100% reliable  or it isn't reliable at all. (2) It doesn't always override my SGS3 lock screen  so I have to enter the unlock pattern before I can snooze or cancel an alarm.

I thought I just didn't hear it but this morning I actually watched as it passed my alarm time without going off. I snoozed a couple times and it showed on screen that it was to go off in 1minute  I waited and then 2 minutes later it showed the time for my next alarm.

The app crashes when I select certain albums from the list and I can't find any discernible reason for the crashes  as all the files are the same format. I used to assume it was the files I purchased through iTunes that wouldn't work  but some of my more recent purchases work while the rest just make the app crash. It's upsetting because all the songs that would be great to wake up to are simply impossible to set.,January 24 2014,2,872

Then manually type in the stations you want to tune/adjust in a tedious process of turn  type  wait  repeat. The alternative is to """"scan"""" them several times to make sure getting one station clear doesn't undo the tuning of another. This  of course  would take several hours if you live anywhere near a metropolitan area. There are 2 or 3 extremely simple UI enhancements that could make this """"simple"""" app actually usable. Since this hasn't happened in the last year  I don't expect it anytime soon. For the love of all that's usable  couldn't you at least retain the list of tuned stations to scroll through?!

Imagine your car speedometer would always display the maximum speed your car can travel at  but not the actual speed right now. How useless!

For days I've been trying to debug a battery charging problem using this app  and was totally misled by this number that it kept displaying. This made me believe that my stock charger (2A output) was working as expected  so I was trying to figure out a problem with my phone instead.

It provides 4 simultaneous bar graphs representing the duty-cycle of processor cycles utilized in each core. Great! But then you find there is a separate box to display the instantaneous clock speed (in GHz  NOT %) of the CPU  so the graph is not normalized to max available processing  but to saturation at the arbitrary instantaneous and momentary clock speed!

You say that gps doesn't need to be on  but it won't auto-connect to saved wifis. I paid for this to get additional addresses automatically connected  but--while the app does turn off the wifi when leaving an active address  it isn't turning back on when entering a known address. I thought the great thing about this app is that it doesn't require gps to remain active. Defeats the purpose if you have to keep gps on constantly.,May 03 2016,1,1526

I was tired of manually enabling and disabling Wifi when I get home or near my favorite hot spots. This does everything for me automatically and saves battery charge in the process. Kudos to such a great app. Update: 8/10/2015. This works well as long as it is running. But it doesn't run all the time. I don't know why it stops running. When I happen to notice that it should have disabled Wifi and check if this app is running or not  that's when it starts. Before this app  I had to manually turn off and on the Wifi. Now with this  I have to manually run this app for it do its job. Ridiculous!,August 10 2015,1,1628

My I.Q. is 142+ (testers unsure how high it really is) just like a lot of you guys and gals. I rooted my Hipstreet Pulse with KingRoot ( no P.C. as mine needs a new UEFI BIOS chip). It checked out as rooted but I restarted this tablet and the Root was gone. I am sorry to the developer but I am at my wit's end.,August 19 2016,1,1668

Problem is  it won't restore them in Android 6. It says it needs to change the permissions in the default app  which it does. But then it just crashes and reboot the phone. No restore ever happens.

7c928487-afc9-11e6-886c-c4b301cdf627,com.zegoggles.smssync,Ok app. Include screenshot of what Gmail looks like with the import. It basically looks like an e-mail chain and the subject doesn't show the phone number no matter how you set it. If you're looking to use this for litigious reasons  you should probably find another app. Ideally  the app should just create a html/text file on your google drive with phone numbers and time stamp of each text in the conversation. Also should show how many and the phone numbers if group text. Finally  just link photo/video source path and extract for MMS.,May 05 2016,2,1741

Swiping Amaze away in the task manager does not remove the notify. Feels like an uphill struggle to do anything. Shame. Uninstalling.,August 05 2016,1,1828
