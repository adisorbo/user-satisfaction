7bde4342-afc9-11e6-a079-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,I would love to have some kind of sleep timer because I really take advantage of the streaming feature. But otherwise it's just perfect!,April 26 2014,5,95
7bde443d-afc9-11e6-ad58-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Awesome  and free What a great way to listen to your whole library. My library is so large that MPD is the only way to navigate it. And with the easy scrolling of this app its a perfect front end for my galaxy s 3. Thank you namelessdev  I hope it keeps getting better with time!,March 25 2014,5,95
7bde44bd-afc9-11e6-9ce1-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Nice  but not perfect I'm used to play music on my squeezebox with the app squeeze commander. Recently made the switch to mpd. I like it a lot. But the client's for android are not very good (compared to squeeze commander). I miss the random function on songs/genre/year the most. For me that would be a high priority addition for mpdroid,March 17 2014,4,95
7bde4540-afc9-11e6-9b76-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Actually life changing! I listen to twice as much music since getting this. Easily the best MPD remote out there!

7bde463a-afc9-11e6-af13-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Better Artist/Song grouping would make it 5* I'd vote this 5* if it did the following in Artists view. 1# could show all songs by artist instead of having to choose an album. 2# grouping of artist could ignore capital letters e.g. 'Arcade fire' and 'Arcade Fire' together instead of separate entries.,March 07 2014,4,95

7bde473d-afc9-11e6-b7be-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Interface is not so intuitive but it is very functional and appealing app A tutorial upon launch could reduce the learning curve in using this app. Nonetheless I can now listen to my MP3 collection located in my server from any device at home or away from it. This app is great for mobiles/tablets. It would be great to have the functionality to download the lyrics.,March 01 2014,4,95

7bde4b9c-afc9-11e6-8927-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,UI is unintuitive but still the best MPD client on Google Play The last updates made the UI really whack in my opinion. You swipe left  and then right  and don't return to where you came from. Also the back button is inconsistent  sometimes it steps back like expected  sometimes it quits the whole app. That being said  thanks for making this great app! It works great with Mopidy and best of all its free!,February 05 2014,4,95
7bde4c28-afc9-11e6-9736-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Great with Volumio on RPi Better than the standard Volumio web interface. Finally got FLAC audio wireless streaming to amp using Volumio on Raspberry Pi controlled via MPDroid on Android. Awesome  thanks.,January 24 2014,5,95

7bde4e28-afc9-11e6-9bfc-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Very few crashes. Excellent UI. We use this to control our MPD server at our hip coffee shop. Works great even with big playlists.

7bde4ff3-afc9-11e6-aa93-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Looks great Tried this app to connect to music box for raspberry pi (linked to Spotify) as I wasn't to keen on their web interface. It works pretty well but it won't load songs lists for any album. It can play any of my predefined playlists though. If it could do this it would definitely be 5 star. Good work looks great.,January 04 2014,4,95
7bde5080-afc9-11e6-8231-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Simple & very useful app. I use this app to control minidnlna running on RasberryPi  which inturn is hooked upto a Denon receiver. Listening to music is just a breeze with Mpdroid on my S2. Cheers developers !!!,January 03 2014,5,95

7bdde366-afc9-11e6-ab48-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Best android mpd client. My only complaint is that it's missing avahi/zeroconf support. It doesn't even need to discover mpd servers  just local hostname resolution would be enough. Other than that it's perfect.,August 03 2016,5,96

7bdde468-afc9-11e6-8a5b-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Good but need to change Well  the app already good for me except one thing. It's the server connection configure. We should have profile instead of connect based on connected WiFi. And it should ask which profile we want each time we start app. The WiFi option is good but when I have 2 server in same WiFi connection it became complicated. And I have to wait a while  let it try connecting before I can change setting to another server.,July 08 2016,4,96
7bdde4ee-afc9-11e6-90ab-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Very nice Another one using it to control a raspberry pi music box. Does a fine job. Design could be a bit more tactile (drag and drop to move things around the queue rather than so many long clicks)  but its just a minor nit.,July 06 2016,5,96
7bdde56e-afc9-11e6-bf53-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,On Moto X Play it is kind of weird. I need to open VLC first (I guess to initialize the DSP?) then enable notification & streaming in MPDroid  and only then it works. Otherwise it plays but no sound.

Maybe I will have to rework that folder into better shape to make more of the artwork accessible.",March 26 2015,4,96

7bde08d1-afc9-11e6-8879-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,The best MPD client on mobile devices MPDroid is by far the best MPD client on mobile devices. It's actually better than several full desktop clients I've tried. It's easy to use  does a great job of displaying cover art (check the mpdroid wiki)  lets you browse by folder structure or by tags and is all round very neat. The only long term annoyance I've noticed compared to a desktop client like gmpc is it doesn't support the composer metadata field but anyway it does let you go to the album folder so if you have any kind of sensible tagging and naming scheme you can always get the info you need. MPDroid improves with each release and MPD + MPDroid still has a place as a great way to enjoy your music collection  even in these days of DLNA/UPNP devices.,March 04 2015,4,96

7bde0cf5-afc9-11e6-bd23-c4b301cdf627,com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Wonderful MPD client. I use MPDroid to control my Raspberry Pi running music box  and it works nearly seamlessly. A beautiful UI I prefer using instead of the HTML interface built into the distro. My one complaint is that adding albums to the queue adds the songs in reverse order. A couple suggestions: change the UI so that switching from Artists to Albums to Songs works by swiping instead of a drop down menu  change the queue menu so that changing the queue is more gesture based instead of popup menu based.,February 12 2015,5,96

7bdaa44c-afc9-11e6-9876-c4b301cdf627,org.dsandler.apps.markers,Impressive While this app is very simple - 4 brush types  set color pallate  no layers  no redo - it does respond to pressure on devices without built-in pressure sensitivity as advertised. I haven't found anything like it elsewhere  even in paid apps. Definitely worth considering as at least a utility to use with other apps if you want to draw on a phone or tablet.,March 26 2016,5,279

7bdaaeba-afc9-11e6-bce7-c4b301cdf627,org.dsandler.apps.markers,Incredibly simple and straightforward  kind of to a fault. Even though it does I can't really say it suffers from a lack of features because it's design philosophy is different than what you would expect  with a really simple design in mind it manages to be a comfortable and fun tool that's easy to use.,February 10 2016,4,279

7bdac7c5-afc9-11e6-ba7e-c4b301cdf627,org.dsandler.apps.markers,Thanks! I didn't expect much  yet I am overjoyed with how well this app works. My only request would be a current color tile with a color picker. Amazed how easy and simple it is. I love how you can create a background  then load an image with a transparency over it. I am using it for web design. Other apps are hard to use  loaded with features and filters that are useless or cost extra just to activate stuff. Most paid apps have a roadmap that dead ends  anyway. It's great to see something wonderful for free. Update... I created a bunch of textures as a backdrop for my logo. Both created in markers  but now  all of the sudden the program is clearing the screen when I load the logo over the texture. I would rather have it just loading on top  like it has been doing. Still love it! 5 stars all day.,November 19 2015,5,279

7c122e63-afc9-11e6-a0a4-c4b301cdf627,com.thibaudperso.sonycamera,Great  basic application that does just what it says. Using my HX50V and basic Android phone  I can get 2-3 hours of shots before the camera battery dies. (Using an external battery pack would easily double the time.) My only complaint is it seems to miss lots of shots. For example  if you set the interval at 15s for one hour  you'd expect 240 shots. But I usually only end up with 100 or so and there are gaps of 3-5 minutes between some shots. No idea what causes it and would like to fix.

Once connected most is OK  the camera allows you control still to set the framing correct before starting the auto time lapse shutter. Main downside is  the app and phone need to be on for it to work  if the phone goes on standby  so does your time lapse. The picture count is a lie  it counts how many pictures should have taken in the given configuration instead of the actual count  which sometimes is less.,May 19 2015,4,626

7c738254-afc9-11e6-8f64-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Excellent podcast app I'm very pleased with AntennaPod. It does exactly what it says on the label and it does it very well. It allows you to subscribe  download and organize your podcasts in a very intuitive way without any extraneous bells and whistles  and it just works. As other reviewers have said  it's a far better  more user-friendly app than many commercial podcatchers I've tried  so kudos to the AntennaPod team for keeping it free and open source!,June 20 2016,5,841
7c73831c-afc9-11e6-93cc-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Well made This free app is easy to use and has no ads. What I love is that you can easily download your podcasts and listen to them later. We do that all the time for road trips.,June 20 2016,5,841
7c7383a6-afc9-11e6-bbf2-c4b301cdf627,de.danoeh.antennapod,Favourite. Like many other reviewers here  I've installed and rejected countless pod apps during my 7 years with Android phones. Antennapod is  by a considerable margin  the best I've used. Without fuss  it seems to have all the features I want  and none of the bloat I don't need. I'd happily pay for it if it didn't happen to be free...,June 20 2016,5,841

I tried a lot of others since Google abandoned thier Listen app and this is the best replacement in my opinion. Nice looking  functional interface. All the queueing  playback  and download options I need. You can automate downloads for each subscription. Queue playback settings help avoid accidental deletion or skipping. Very granular settings  which I like. But easy enough to operate while driving or walking. Playback speed is still in beta as of this review but has been working fine for me.,June 08 2016,5,841

I can understand why you would buy one. But how would I know I would keep listening to podcasts enough to justify me buying anything. I looked for several free options until I stumbled into antennapod. So far i love it  and really appreciate that it is open source. You guys have really done the world a service with your app.,June 02 2016,5,841

Ads  cluttered layouts  and complex apps were all I found. However in a comments section I saw this app recommended  and I must say its great.

It has a clear and simple UI with some advanced option such as the automatic download of new podcasts and automatically erasing old or played podcasts. I suggest two improvements: the podcast search only shows the top US podcasts. enhancing the podcast search  improving the suggestions  filtering by language or display related podcasts would be a great plus. The second point is the sync possibilities. So far  you can only sync through gpodder that times out a lot.,August 15 2016,5,843

Small Complaint: After I selected my podcasts  I wanted to use it on my PC  but it's Android only.

It also has useful sharing features and I like the way that it organizes episodes. My only complaint is that it exhibits odd back-button behavior  often bringing me back to Android home instead of the previous page in the app. Also  playback occasionally stops when running Waze. This behavior is rare enough that I haven't bothered to investigate.,August 11 2016,4,843

Fast forward to this version of the official Kodi remote and I honestly can't find any fault with it as a remote. Does everything I need it to do and more. Only caveat (might save some heartache) is that windows kodi users will need to install Apple's Bonjour Networking service in order to get it working and then deal with the pain of configuring the apple software to stop calling home and asking if it can install other apple software.,June 26 2016,5,1135

The option to get rid of the bottom menu on the actual remote screen would be nice  as I tend to hit them when I'm using the remote to browse add ons in Kodi  sending me to a different category,June 09 2016,4,1135

7c42d08c-afc9-11e6-855a-c4b301cdf627,org.xbmc.kore,Simply Amazing! Works as expected...

7c42dc00-afc9-11e6-8084-c4b301cdf627,org.xbmc.kore,Awesome  but could be better. This is one of the best Kodi remotes. However I'm using Yatse still due to the additional options they offer and plug-ins to do even more. Kore is great if you want want a simple remote to works flawlessly.,May 28 2016,4,1135
7c42dcba-afc9-11e6-a62b-c4b301cdf627,org.xbmc.kore,Great App Would it be possible to add play from here content menu option for TV shows,May 28 2016,4,1135

Using one of those device controllers or mice just don't cut it. Having Kore in my .hands makes my experience better I keep coming back night after night.,May 06 2016,5,1135
7c42eff3-afc9-11e6-a2b3-c4b301cdf627,org.xbmc.kore,Great app! The app is absolutely fantastic  especially when used with Kodibuntu on a computer with Ethernet. Works like a dream  would recommend to anyone willing to modernise their home entertainment center. All you need is an older PC and Kodibuntu and you're all set. Just two things I'd love to see in the app though: the ability to set the shutdown timer in the app itself and that when you select a song in the app it starts playing the album from there  not just the song and then it stops. Other than that: superb.,May 05 2016,5,1135

7c42f36e-afc9-11e6-b6a7-c4b301cdf627,org.xbmc.kore,Idea for next update Have a shortcut to favourites in the same way there are shortcuts to videos  music etc. When searching  the ability to be able to use the phones key pad would be amazing. All in all this is a must have for kodi users  although can be a little slow responding.,May 01 2016,5,1135
7c42f3f0-afc9-11e6-b262-c4b301cdf627,org.xbmc.kore,Great remote  I'd give 5 stars if there's a keyboard! Love it otherwise.,April 30 2016,4,1135
