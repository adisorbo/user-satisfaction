7ccc6a4a-afc9-11e6-b619-c4b301cdf627,org.scid.android,Great to have  especially for free (I sorta wish I could pay $5 for a fully-developed version  but I suspect the developer is restricted by the open-source licence of the source code). As others have commented  it lacks some key features; for me  the buzz-kill is the inability to add comments. A bummer as I use this to create databases of books while I'm reading them. A work-around is to add comments on your computer via SCID or any of its variants. I had to do the following: Copy the 3 files associated with the database to my local computer  change the permissions  edit them in SCID or any of its variants  copy them back onto the Android device  then reload the database (for effects to be seen  one must load any random database and then reload the edited database).,October 20 2016,4,282

7ccc6fc2-afc9-11e6-b9f6-c4b301cdf627,org.scid.android,Only it should use arrows for best moves in analyze mode like droidfish. And board search should have option to search only one side(white or black) piece positions. If possible it should show players clock times for pgn files with move times.( FICS ICC FIDELIVE pgn) And should show move times chart. Wish you all best!!!,April 03 2016,4,282

I love how addicting it is  and how everytime I play it's never the same layout.

However  with skill  the starter equipment can take you up to level 5 easy  by which point you're almost gareunteed to find better stuff.

The randomized dungeons and different classes keep things fresh. My only problem is that many playthroughs can be cut short by the difficulty.

17417098-affd-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Hated the gear degradation at first but.. When the game added degradation  I started playing Pixel Dungeon: Shattered instead  and while that was fun at first  it also became pretty easy quite quickly. Further  Shattered also felt a little bloated; I felt like rather than surviving the dungeon  I found myself farming and self-sustaining rather than the urgent need to finish the quest before my resources ran out. I went back to give the original Pixel Dungeon and found it so much more exciting and challenging. Though  degradation should be optional.,September 06 2015,5,299

Very addicting  has that one more playthrough kind of game play. Like most rougelikes  it's unbelievably unforgiving  if you get greedy and want that loot that's in the skeleton  get ready to die. Run into a wraith level 2? Goodbye. All they ask is donations  no IAP that I've seen. Can be frustrating  but if you don't want to be frustrated  find a different genre.

You'll see some negative reviews complaining about item durability: they miss the point. The game is about resource management  so a powerful magic item will degrade more quickly.

I've easily spent 30+ hours of my life playing so far and still haven't beaten it! But I still come back since its actually fun  brutal and (mostly) fair. Luck sometimes play a major part however  but thats only because of the nature of random generation and rougelike games. Other than that  its a great game which other free games on the app store should strive to be like.,August 15 2016,4,300

This game requires strategy and your brain power on solving puzzles and secrets. No no  I'm not going to tell anyone any secrets  this isn't what I'm writing for  I'm writing this because I'm thanking the developers for creating this game! Definitely a 10/5 star app!

28bf0302-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Great game but one problem. Super fun. Love rouglike games and this one is a gooder. But I found after 3 days of slaving over it and reading wiki I still can not get past the 2nd boss on floor ten. The game is too hard  to the point that you are playing over and over just to get that one lucky run. No matter how good you are or many hours you play it's all up to that one lucky run. To me that loses you a star. But still worth playing if you are born of the generation that suffered through the no save points and one life lol,August 06 2016,4,300

2b81cc8c-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,You can't go wrong A free game without DLC or annoying microtransactions - that alone places this enjoyable game in a rarefied air. After a couple of years of on-and-off play of this game  I finally managed to complete it; appropriately with a sliver of health remaining. It's frustrating  compelling  surprising and most importantly fun - like all Roguelikes it seems gruelling at the best of times and impossible at worst. Donated after I realised I was having a great time - worth every dollar  and then some. Cheers  Watabou.,August 04 2016,4,300

8bb4b883-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Amazingly Fun and Challenging Game! If you like roguelikes then this game is a must-have for you. There are a ton of interlocking mechanics that make this game very unique. As the description states  this game is very difficult and luck-based. I have never won a single run yet although I've played over 100 games; I barely made it to the final boss once on my best run. To succeed in Pixel Dungeon you'll need a decent understanding of the game's mechanics  good resource management  and luck. All in all  this game is amazing! Can only recommend!,June 22 2016,5,300

You have minimal quick health options  and  unless you have a scroll of identify on hand  you just have to take your chances with the potions. Yes  you can heal with food  but WHAT SELF-RESPECTING PLAYER WOULD USE THEIR FOOD RATIONS TO HEAL?! Sorry I just get kind of sensitive to this kind of thing.

Definitely my favourite game on the app store  been playing for over a year now and the new features are good.

I highly recommended this game to anyone that like a old style rpg like game  but there's some stuff that i hope the developer tweak tho.

There's a perfect blend of fun  logic and a little bit of a challenge all mixed together to make this roguelike phenomenon. It's not the best game I've ever played  but it would definitely be on my top ten list. Now  if there was only an ability to craft your own weapons... you already got partially there with the option brewing. Really fun  9.5/10.,April 04 2016,5,300

70bc020a-aff0-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,I love this game  I can play it for a few minutes on break at work  standing in line or i can play it for hours while i try to fall asleep or i'm waiting for my cue to pop. I have yet to beat the lvl 15 boss... but i've made it there with a warrior and mage... still having trouble with that little rouge... I cant seem to beat lvl 10 with him... but i will... one day  i want to see his mastery! I would say get this game if your easily enteratined  the map  pots and scrolls change every time you start over. Warriors will always know a pot of strength  mages a scroll of identifay  and rouges seem to like maps. There is some other cool little perks about the classes  but its better to figure out as you play. I'm giving it 5 stars... cant wait to see what lvl 16 looks like  or the huntress for that matter.,April 01 2016,5,300

Easy to pick up and play but difficult to master since it requires abit of planning and LARGE amount of luck. Degradation on weapons is seriously not fun since it adds unnecessary worry on top of the contant hunger status. Fun nonetheless but a bit too much RNG can be bad. Shattered Pixel Dungeon is much more fair in comparison.,February 26 2016,4,300

However  I do not think it's fair that the only girl in the whole game is the huntress - bit yet  I wonder why - she's locked. I mean  give us girls a break! I have tried time and time again to kill the 3rd boss to unlock her  to my failure for the 1 000 time (or something like that).

Sometimes luck is in my favor and other times not so much. Knowing how much HP I have would be helpful if it could be listed in the bar instead of just a graphical representation. Also if the option to have a second quickslot could be permanently changed when I select it that would be great. Gets a little tiresome having to reselect it every new game.,February 17 2016,5,300

To fix the problem of using all upgrade scrolls on one item  just to repair it  an idea could be to add random drops used to repair items  and make them a drop from common enemies. Please consider this  because there's nothing I hate more than not being able to upgrade my armour  all because of my +6 warhammer is broken.

91a186fb-aff1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Fun but hard Sometimes it feels like the game decides if it wants you to do well or not. One time I killed the first three bosses. Now I'm struggling to get past the first one. It's a little ridiculous how helpless you are sometimes. It's worth playing though,February 14 2016,4,300

92a3187e-aff1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Great game but... Would like to see an update to keep up with it's competition. It could even be bug fixes but  to look and see that it hasn't been touched since December and the others February; you begin to question is it still in development. A nice feature to add would be a trinket slot and have like 20 different trinkets that we could use. Many people liked TBOIs different gameplay scheme and that would be nice here as well,February 13 2016,4,300

d0530714-aff1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,A challenging  pixelated master piece. I have always been a fan of pixelated style games  and more so for dungeon RPG exploration type ones. Pixel Dungeon blends all my favorite flavors together quite perfectly to create a simple yet challenging  risk-taking  and loot finding game  that has striped me countless hours  and turned it into rage hard fun. This is one of the best yet simple games I've played so far. Much love for this game and it's awesome developers  hope to see more updates with tons of new stuff if possible. 😊 p.s. it's on PC too,February 10 2016,5,300

It's deadly punishing  but it makes it that much more rewarding to beat the game. You have to be really careful with what you're given - every item down to the last dewdrop counts! - and in the deeper you go the more strategic you have to be.

d4515de3-aff1-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,My favorite roguelike game This game has an incredible amount of complexity and replayability. I played about 200 games before I figured most of it out. After 550 games I have finally beat the game with all 4 classes and made it back out to the top with the warrior. Great sound effects and music. A typical game can last you anywhere from 1 minute to an hour. A great quick diversion that can hold your attention for a long time. I only have 4 more badges to get! You won't regret getting this game. The best part? NO ADS!,February 07 2016,5,300

For such a small game (especially on a phone where I don't expect actual fun most of the time)  I find myself playing a lot of this. -The only problem I have found so far is the food mechanic. It seems arbitrary as to how much it fills you up  but it never lasts very long. I always seem to be starving by mid level 2-3 of each run.,February 07 2016,4,300

222a910e-aff2-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Amazing and addicting! I love the game despite my lack of experience with roguelikes. Still haven't beaten it yet but I play it constantly. One thing I might recommend though is rebalancing he hunger and food  either make satiety points decrease slower  increase the potency of food and the satiety point cap  or increase the frequency of food drops. Starvation has been the thing that killed me the most  and I'm very sparing with any food I get only eating when starving. Would be 5 stars if not for the hunger!,January 27 2016,4,300

24277284-aff2-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Amazing I feel the best part about this game was that it is not addicting. It's fun. The two words have a difference. I actively want to play pixel dungeon. Yet games like coc basically force you to come back  and then leave right away. My only complaint is of how it isn't super balanced  where most playthroughs you have no chance  and some you get a lightning wand in the first room you find. Other than that  pixel dungeon is a fun game definitely worth trying out.,January 26 2016,5,300
24355535-aff2-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Overall addictive First things first: if you find a way to conserve food  take it. Sometimes you will be spending a long time on a floor and starving is a common death. (Also  go to settings and activate second quickslot) This game is very fun  being able to drag you in for a hour at a time. But  thanks to it saving every move you make  you can stop at any time. There's a massive level of customization in playstyle.,January 26 2016,4,300

776a7273-aff2-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Amazing game I have had this game on three different devices and played it for almost two years. I have beaten it with the Warrior  the Mage  and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes  the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low  or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level  and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise. Stand in water while fighting to wash away his caustic ooze and use an earth root for added protection. Good luck!!,January 17 2016,5,300

Example: Dracula's Curse of Pixel Dungeon. Just a example  probably something better. Also  make it be like $0.99 for DLC  or at least $2.00? Plz make a new chapter or something cool to the strory!,January 16 2016,5,300

Also I would not kill you even if u add some adds. Make it so that u get enough money to keep updating and donations remove adds. That would surely help u bring more content. But don't do too much adds. Just the right amount.... :),December 24 2015,5,300
f4587481-aff3-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Highly recommend it. Quality game. The art is clean  informative  and uniform in style. The interface is intuitive and nonobtrusive. The gameplay is what you would expect from a rogue like; a challenging experience with variety and replayability. Some people may find the permadeath concept frustrating at first  but i think it works really well  especially on a mobile game. I think it the characters feel a little too similar in playstyle  but otherwise this game is very complete  rather bug free  and a very good game overall.,December 24 2015,5,300

Its not as good as the original by far IF YOU LIKE THIS GAME I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PLAY NETHACK FOR THE ANDRIOD blows this game out of the water difficulty and content wise.

The controls are easy to follow  unlike other games where you have to use some complex joystick thing. And the scrolls and the potions are pretty simple to guess of their effects just by looking at the names. And since every game is different  every game I play will always keep me hooked and ready to kick some rat butt.,December 23 2015,5,300

No stupid in app purchases (it doesn't have them  Play Store said so because you can make a completely optional donation) no ridiculous waiting times  no ads  no pay walls. And the game is really great and not repetitive because of random generation. It's quite difficult but challenging and rewarding  so If you haven't already got it download it now! Please don't rate it bad for permadeath. It's a roguelike.,December 22 2015,5,300
fb074453-aff3-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,This is my absolute favorite game. Ever. Seriously though. I wish it were a bit more complex  like Nethack or even ToME or Cataclysm  but nobody seems to have successfully adapted those to an ergonomic mobile interface  so Pixel Dungeon is always my number one choice if I've got some time to kill (and even if I don't  haha).

As an added bonus this game is truly free to play. No in-game purchase of any kind to bother you or to offer an easy way out of a tricky situation. Just a very unobtrusive button to donate.

It's suprisingly in-depth  ad free  strategic  and addicting in the best way possible. Even the underlying story is really good! The game as a whole brings about a feeling of nostalgia echoing from memories of plundering dungeons in the original legend of zelda. Really difficult until you figure out that you don't mess with giant piranhas EVER. My only regret is finding this game the week before finals.

Played over 200 sessions before I wiped my Nexus 5 and I got pretty good! There are certain tactics you should follow  some which gurantee an enchanted very powerful weapon and powerful armor! Psst  skip floors 21-23... Just save magic mapping for them and go to exit directly  they're WAY too hard  never explored them in any playthrough.

I've been playing this game since it was new and even though it can be challenging   I still play it regularly ( min. 2 hours a day ). Patience  stubbornness and adaptivity are needed to get to the later levels or beating to game. If you die just try again and learn the behavior of the enemies in-game so you can hopefully beat the game yourself.,October 20 2015,5,300

c2138c51-aff8-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Addicting Rougelike I enjoy Rougelikes like FTL or dungeons of Dreadmore. And I gotta say this is a fun one if you can get past the first boss. It is in the spirit of your early encounters make or  more than likely  break your game. Rougelikes are good at giving you a feeling of accomplishment when you  after multiple tries  finally get farther then your first trial. This game does just that  and the sense of exploration is very real. Great game and super fast download  worth it.,October 19 2015,5,300

7ccecaba-afc9-11e6-ab2c-c4b301cdf627,name.boyle.chris.sgtpuzzles,Stellar app The customizability  ease of use  lack of ads  multitude of games  and randomly generated puzzles makes this the best app  by far  for any puzzler. My only complaint is that within Black Box  there is no option to automatically fire the laser beams after generating a puzzle. But even this is very minor and only begins to show itself in the larger grids. 10/10 overall and in almost every category.

I'm solving puzzles from a month ago  so I have to scroll through a hundred puzzles to get to where I want. How about defaulting instead to the bottom of the list of available puzzles  or at least the latest one I was working on? It's the same when I clear finished puzzles - it defaults to the top of the list - the latest puzzles  instead of where I am working. This would make the app pert near perfect.

Between the vast selection of puzzle libraries and the live-ish updating of ongoing publications  I'll never run out of games to play. Note  however  that I've been running Shortyz for years and although the app does get updated from time to time  the updates are sporadic at best. Bugs can go months before being addressed. The current bug plaguing the game is the Clues view zooms in ridiculously on the letter grid  making it difficult to use. But  like I said  the app does get updated and things do get fixed in time.

7bfbd580-afc9-11e6-9401-c4b301cdf627,com.totsp.crossword.shortyz,Thanks for your latest update (Nov. 2014). This app has many great features  and we appreciate your continous improvements. One bug from this last update was fixed as I was writing this - fast work! Now  if you can just make the in-app keyboard better  I will happily give you 5 stars. I have small hands and fingers  but still miss the correct letter as often as I hit it. Since I really like the app feature which keeps track of errors (which I rarely make)  typing errors are frustrating as well as time-consuming. Looking forward to this fix.

I tend to tap on a square and then immediately tap it again to change from across to down or vice versa. I basically double tap a lot while moving around. Since the update  about half the time  when I perform this double tap  it's like I triple tapped. Eg  it highlights the row  switches to the column (where it should stop)  but after a brief pause  it switches to the row again. Irritating  but not debilitating.

Of course there are a few glitches here or there but the developer is responding quickly. I think sheer volume of negative responses demonstrates how many people rely on this app every day  and let's remember it's free without any ads or anything. Let's all be a little more patient when we notice a small issue. I can guarantee the dev won't leave us with a broken app for long (and in my experience it's far from broken) Further  if you're having an issue with a specific puzzle  I can virtually guarantee it's because that source has changed something. When that happens this app's dev has always been very quick to respond whenever possible (it's not always within his power).,November 26 2014,5,734

Quite frustratingly  you can't get very far on the main quest as many of the locations and the story just haven't been written yet. I played this two or three years ago and gave up as I ran out of things to do. This time round there is a little more but not on the main storyline which is still stalled at more or less the same point. A real shame as it is really pretty good.,May 09 2016,4,771

7be76a6b-afc9-11e6-8582-c4b301cdf627,com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail,Good but movement changes would be appreciated The game is OK but my only gripe is moving is extremely clunky. I understand that this is a work in progress and I am sure that you will add a walking animation in the future. Still there is a problem. With the way that you move the character you are unable to pan the camera around. I would suggest adding a virtual DPad on the screen for moving and have touching and dragging the screen pan the camera around. This will make it much easier to see where you're going.,May 08 2016,4,771

7be7914a-afc9-11e6-947e-c4b301cdf627,com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail,This truly is a great RPG game at it's core. Simple  yet difficult. It's D&D. Which is great. Although at times the Hit Chance seems to take a mind of it's own (89%? No I think there is a decimal point missing there...8.9 sounds more correct with my playthrough haha) The only gripe I have at the moment is that gold is really hard to come by. Loot is worth nothing and healing items are impossibly expensive. Would it be possible to add (Or maybe it's there and I can't find it?) a way to actually cook the meat that we find as loot? It's the only way I can see that I 'm going to be able to actually finish this quest. Monsters get far too strong far too fast and without money I can't get past it.,February 05 2016,4,771

The only problems I see are the stuttering effects produced when you press and hold in a direction to move. It may cause a stroke in people whom are sensitive to things like that. Also  are we supposed to update it ourselves? Since its open source  and hasn't been updated for 1 year and 8 months  it's like we players whom know how to program a game are supposed to update it ourselves. If it isn't the case  I kindly ask of you  the dev  to start developing it again.,October 29 2015,5,771

No fast travel  slow leveling and gold acquisition  too many monsters  and level benefits are minimal; you'll find at level 10 you're not much stronger than you were 4 hours ago when you started. I recommend a hex editor to give yourself a small boost to stand a chance. +100 hp and 20 skill points and you might stand a chance without spending weeks grinding.,October 25 2015,4,771

The graphics are great  the storyline engaging  the monsters tough (when and where they are supposed to be...) And the rare items really are rare and often worth keeping. The only downside here is that there is no end to the game..... Since the original designer walked away from the project (or so I've read elsewhere).

Maybe I am missing something  idk  its pretty difficult. What do you suggest? Also when your player moves  the back ground moves instantaneous  giving it a sort of lagging look  even thought it isn't laggy  that way it moves it hard on the eye and makes it difficult to move and dodge dangerous creatures for me anyway.

7be85670-afc9-11e6-81a4-c4b301cdf627,com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail,Abandoned? This is a fun game. Dialogue is humorous  combat system is deep  and there's plenty of quests to complete. It's most certainly unfinished  though - with many dead-ends  several broken/uncompletable quests  and a very 'early beta' feel about it.

You can see any enemy's stats by tapping on their picture under the attack button. There are enemies you can barely get through a fight with as a low level player that won't be able to damage you any at all later on. Things may seem high priced early on but a little later money won't be an issue and you will have more than you need.,November 27 2014,5,771

I downloaded this three times before i actually decided to give it a try. The only things to make this game better than it already is is to add some music and touch tones  it gets kind of dead without some good music. Also  when is the maps all gonna be input? Or do you just have to complete certain tasks to get farther on like across the river west of loneford. I defeated the river troll. Overall good game.,June 24 2014,4,771

7be904a8-afc9-11e6-929d-c4b301cdf627,com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail,Incredible One of the only actually free games on the market. Tons of fun to play and I love that I can play it with one hand. If there was anything that I would suggest changing it would be to make NPCs stand still because it sucks trying to get out of a building but getting trapped by an endless dialogue wall. Also maybe put a recommended level or difficulty level assigned to each area. Some other cool additions would be a crafting system like for potions and cooking meat  and showing which npcs have quests to give.,March 11 2014,5,771

7cc7f4ae-afc9-11e6-b35d-c4b301cdf627,com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,Favorite Mobile Game The Original Pixel Dungeon has long been my favorite game on my cell. Shattered Pixel Dungeon has since surpassed the original game  however. For those of you looking for a fresh Pixel Dungeon experience  this one is simply the best. (There are many to choose from.) For those of you who are new to Pixel Dungeon: This game's charm lies in its misleading simplicity. You will die. A lot. Those who enjoy learning from their mistakes in video games will enjoy this thoroughly. I cannot recommend this game enough,August 11 2016,5,799

I assume he has a day job outside of managing this app  but he still fixed it ASAP. A good game is one thing  but a good  totally free game that has very minimal downtime and quick issue resolution is truly great. Also a big fan of the regular upgrades\tweaks to improve it incrementally and how frequently the dev will listen to the players and have a dialog about tips  and new ideas.,August 11 2016,5,799

7cc7fb05-afc9-11e6-874a-c4b301cdf627,com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,Very awesome roguelike  but I encountered a little problem. Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a vast improvement over the original Pixel Dungeon formula. It has got rebalanced features and quality of life improvements. I have played SPD for quite some time  having played around 120 times already.Out of these tries I had won the game 5 times. I still keep coming back to check new features like class reworks and addition of new weapons + items. Strange  but latest update got an error which doesn't show details of old playtroughs. A mild discomfort that I hope can be fixed.,August 10 2016,5,799

I really like this game  but I don't really like how since you don't start with the mastery tome anymore it feels to difficult to progress... I want to keep playing the game but the fact that every run is ENTIRELY up to chance  the fact that I no longer have anything to unlock to help me get back to the later levels leaves me bored quickly.

7cc8136e-afc9-11e6-99bb-c4b301cdf627,com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,One minor minor bug but phenomenal game The game is amazing (still can't make it past level 17 no matter how hard I try) just want to say the developer is great this is the best of the pixel dungeon knock offs  the minor bug is that when you fall into the level below and it sometimes occurs on top of a monster making u have to step away from it get hit then proceed to attack it  like I said minor minor  but it would be nice if you killed it on impact.

I do however have one complaint about the mage class  even with the recent overhaul of the wands if a better wand can not be found within the first five floors it becomes very difficult to defeat the slime and move on where as with the other classes it is relatively constant that better weapons and armor can be found.,July 16 2016,4,799

7cc825c0-afc9-11e6-91a5-c4b301cdf627,com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,Really liked the game before this new update. Taking away the upgrade =lower strength to use was unnecesary. Also there are not enough low level weapon and armor options to survive much past the goo most of the time.

What I do find ironic though  is whatever class you play  anything that would be useful to that class does not drop. For example. I like to play the mage but wands almost never dropped. Whereas  I play The Warrior  and four wands drop by the time I hit the eight level. It's just not one or two times I've played. I played hundreds of times on all characters. It's a great game  very hard  and I love to play it. But it seems the drop rate for that class is horrible.,August 30 2016,4,800

7cc7e6ab-afc9-11e6-b077-c4b301cdf627,com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,I love this game I started playing the original Pixel Dungeon almost 3 years ago and last year I found this version and I've fallen in love with both. If I could make a small suggestion  make a game that focuses on the city above the dungeons. I know that would probably be a huge undertaking and take a lot of time to make  but I feel like fans would really enjoy it. Just my two cents though  so it's whatever. Great game though. 5/5,August 27 2016,5,800

However have beaten the floor 20 boss a number of times but it seems as soon as I reach the next sort of lava+future stage I die on the first floor. If any tweaks are possible they would be extremely appreciated as I sail through floors 15-20 then as soon as I hit floor 22  even with about 15 health potions I get hit 60 each turn by creatures and just die.

My only frustration with the game is getting a weapon with an enchantment only to see the enchantment disappear after a few upgrades. Those enchantments take the fun level of the game to another level simply because you don't use them every run. Maybe make enchanted weapons rarer to find but make the enchaments permanent to the weapon? Just a suggestion...keep up the good work!,August 13 2016,5,800

It's a ton of fun and totally addicting. However  there is one thing that I cannot stand...after playing hundreds of runs and making it to the final boss only once it seems apparent that the game beats you 9 times out of 10 before you even start.

All you noobs who whines about you cannot play this game  or that game  know your stuff beforehand or check the goddamn ppsspp FAQ. disable fast memory if it often crashes in game. use auto frameskip and 1X rendering for slow games. FYI  some game are incompatible at all. MediaTek mt6580 with mali mp400 mp2 could work it but on 2x psp render  some scenes are still choppy.,November 04 2016,4,922

7c52d400-afc9-11e6-8617-c4b301cdf627,org.ppsspp.ppsspp,Works when tweaked properly: I had to keep tweaking settings for it to work well. Galaxy S7 Edge is my example. There are hella choices for rendering options and more. The trick is to configure screen resolution  frameskips  and emulated processor overclocking. Initially the default 100% psp's GHZ is choppy (audio too)  I use 200% psp's performance  achieving full intended speed on Grand Turismo. Battery drain is impressively low unless your display is bright and/or high resolution. I expect good newish phones to use this app well.,October 28 2016,5,922

7c53d723-afc9-11e6-bfde-c4b301cdf627,org.ppsspp.ppsspp,Great but it looks like these updates made it slower. The game will now lag a little bit/decreases fps after a loading screen or checkpoint. Fast speed will go back again if and only if I open my notification panel or adjust the volume (in response with my phone's user interface  or anything in my UI must show up in my screen  the emulation will go back to its normal speed again). I hope you notice this one too  I'll be waiting for the upcoming update.,October 19 2016,4,922

My only thought is fixing the touch screen interface  I have read a few reviews and some people say it's there under audio  however on my HTC ONE I don't have this option so on a smaller android screen it would work better as opposed to the drag and click mouse style that is currently implemented.

I loved using ScummVM to relive childhood gaming  and now that I can play it on the go is truly remarkable. For those saying it doesn't load  it does - you're just impatient. TIP: don't download from Google Play  this is an outdated build. Go to ScummVM's website  download the latest STABLE build (1.6)  and what goes from a 20-30 second load up was reduced to 3 seconds. Also change the input to """"Mixed Adlib/MIDI"""" to get direct touch mode so you literally point and click. Perfection!",March 03 2014,5,1045

Perfect each and every time as far as I could tell. Controls are great with a choice between a touchpad style of moving the cursor or regular touch screen controls.

Unlike DOSBox  SCUMMVM only emulates the functionality necessary to run your favorite games  and as such is able to do so much more faithfully. You'll need to download the correct plugins to add support for certain games or series. I suggest you only download the ones you plan to actually use.

I like that this one doesnt show you all your possible moves (a lot of the other CC apps seem to do this and you cant get rid of it ;-/ ) Wish it showed your entire move as you did it (once you click to accept the move your ball just appears in the new spot  which I think takes away a bit of the fun). But still seems to be the best CC app out there  :),February 15 2014,4,1099

7ca283d9-afc9-11e6-9d48-c4b301cdf627,org.petero.droidfish,Fantastic app. One little request My only wish is engine time limit in lightbulb mode to save battery. To me 2-3 seconds is usually enough  anything more is a waste of power. I constantly have to switch analysis on/off which is annoying esp. that it also removes the arrows and the engine output. An analysis time limit setting and a button at the bottom telling the engine to continue (if the user wants more depth in some positions) would solve this. Every Android chess app should have this feature as they run on phones with limited battery.,May 10 2016,5,1175

However just one concern that droidfish can drain all my battery in less than 40 minutes when in analysis mode.(Pondering mode switched off). It seems to drain battery even when I have exited it. I understand it's quite an unreasonable demand  but if the developers can find a way to make it drain less battery while still provide excellent quality of analysis  then droidfish would be extraordinarily-incredible!,January 06 2016,5,1175

7ca2e38c-afc9-11e6-85c2-c4b301cdf627,org.petero.droidfish,The Best I've played chess since 2nd grade so its a passion. I have at least 6 other chess apps on my tablet  and this is the only one I use every day. My only real issue with the app is the strength setting is in terms of percentage and not ELO  ELO numbers  mean a lot to a chess player; and to have the strength of the opponent as a meaningless 5 10  50%- of what? Its well below the standard of this app. The GUI is excellent  and Stockfish is of course one the best Engines. I would prefer Delphi or another engine that better simulates human club players for the 2nd Engine. The Presentation  the smoothness of the movement; good rich intuitive menus. Easily moving from Human v Human to Human v Machine allows me to practice against favored openings and key positions. The computer v Computer play allows me to see a position played out by opponents that are a little better than myself or lightyears better. I said  I love chess  I reach for this app everyday. I really think the devs got this one right: but it could be even better!,September 24 2015,4,1175

7ca30a23-afc9-11e6-b0fb-c4b301cdf627,org.petero.droidfish,The mobile chess interface and game to use in android. Droifish is robust  has extensive PGN & analysis support  and has useful features. I find myself converting many .cbh files to pgn in Chessbase and using them in Droidfish for study and analysis. Obviously this app is not for the casual player. Although you can add more unessential features such as kibitzer etc. (a la Chessbase)  what makes the Droidfish highly efficient is that the developer has thoughtfully chosen the most productive features for a mobile implementation. It will no doubt continue to get better due to the dedication and the developer's desire to provide us with a high quality mobile chess game that-unfairly-does not even ask us for donation. I for one  very much appreciate his work. I can play  study analyze productively. Considering that eye catching graphics do not have anything to do with chess  it is simply the most complete chess game for android. Fantastic!,May 05 2015,5,1175
7ca30af5-afc9-11e6-a052-c4b301cdf627,org.petero.droidfish,Tops!!! Droidfish has all the features I need from a chess interface. I have both the ctg opening book and Syzygy endgame Table bases setup to work from external memory card. Quick tabs to start/stop and change engines. Working great with the two top chess engines that I installed  Komodo 9 and Stockfish 6 :) Great software with lots of features and fully free. Amazing! Thank you Mr Osterlund. :) Now  wheres the donation option?,May 04 2015,5,1175
7ca30b8c-afc9-11e6-a2f7-c4b301cdf627,org.petero.droidfish,Really Nice Software Overall I have to give this Chess GUI an 'A'. You can see a lot of thought and hard work has gone into this program. That said there are to items I would like to see addressed. 1: Would like a option to change to Background Color of the Engine Analysis window that pops up/ overlays over the notation window. 2. Would like to see a option for Engine vs Engine with two 'different' programs  such as for example Stockfish vs Komodo and not the current engine plays itself.,April 29 2015,5,1175

7ca30d94-afc9-11e6-89ca-c4b301cdf627,org.petero.droidfish,Nodes and depth on an 8 core tablet On a Sam galaxy tab S 10.5 I get between 900 and 1300 Knodes a second and it thinks to 10 ply(20 half moves) in 5 to10 seconds in the opening. If i let it sit then it rarely goes past 30 half moves even after an hour of up time for one position.,April 24 2015,5,1175

For all the intervening years  the best I can muster is a (maybe) 1200 ELO. The only way to improve for me is to study the game  learn the nuances and most importantly study and play games. This app is an excellent and free start into this type of study and my heartfelt thanks to the developers for giving me this chance to improve!,February 25 2015,5,1175

7c1cfd11-afc9-11e6-b45b-c4b301cdf627,org.scoutant.blokish,Great game! I love the board game Blokus  and this is just like it. Some of the other versions you don't have the ability to flip the pieces  this game you can. I have the Trigon board version also (little pieces are triangle shape). It would be great to have that version too. Can play against the program  or others.,July 23 2016,5,1336

7c1d0135-afc9-11e6-85aa-c4b301cdf627,org.scoutant.blokish,Pretty dang good Three things would make this app worthy of 5 stars: 1. The ability to not just rotate the pieces but to flip them over 2. Playing as different colors 3. More difficulty levels. Otherwise  this is pretty good.,April 16 2016,4,1336

7c1d135e-afc9-11e6-b65e-c4b301cdf627,org.scoutant.blokish,Loving it -- but room for improvements Obviously  the original board game is excellent so it is hard to fail. However  there are several improvements that could be made such as better support for multiple simultaneous players  higher levels of more clever computer adversaries. Also  a few times I have noticed how the yellow player simply gives up early on in the game. How do I play other colors than red?,January 03 2016,4,1336
7c1d148c-afc9-11e6-a5c9-c4b301cdf627,org.scoutant.blokish,Good but you can't position the tiles in every situation,January 02 2016,4,1336

7c1d169c-afc9-11e6-8b44-c4b301cdf627,org.scoutant.blokish,Good game but could be improved It's free  simple  and replicates Blokus well. But it needs more than 4 difficulty levels. Would be nice to be able to change colors since red and orange can be hard to differentiate. Opponent always wins ties. Sometimes blocks get stuck when positioning but can always X out and do the move again. Themes and sound might also be nice.,January 01 2016,4,1336

The only issue I'm dealing with is that oftentimes after I exit out  the next time I try to go back in it crashes. It's hard to get it running again.

7cb8db73-afc9-11e6-b0a6-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Useful but.... Ok this is a great app to play games but lets be honest about this. This still needs improvements like a fast forward button where you can speed up the text or whatever. Second  this app needs to save the games we play because once you uninstall this and reinstall it then the games you played and saved will be gone  bye bye.

7cbaa261-afc9-11e6-ac11-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Has gotten a lot better This emulator has come a long way. When I first tried using it two years ago  it is nearly impossible to play Pokemon. Now  the game can be run with a slight lag on my S5. The app crashes at times  but the autosave feature is a huge saving grace  especially for Pokemon. If the app is really acting up  restart your phone and it should crash less frequently. I don't expect much from a DS emulator for my phone  so I am satisfied by this app. I wouldn't have played these games if it wasn't for the app.,June 12 2016,4,1468

Just need to be fixed sounds and faster  smoother game play but beside that; it is still a great emulator. Also I really appreciate that you put hard work to make this easy-to-use emulator and people need to know that all emulators are supposed to be slow  because the games are meant to be played on Ds and some ROMs don't work because they just don't work. Best of luck improving your Nds Emulator!,April 15 2016,4,1468

7cbb6451-afc9-11e6-95f6-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Severely bad sound quality I still love the fact this app is free and open source. It's truly great and I can't be more thankful for that alone  however I hope the devs will somehow fix the sound issues. Some games like Phoenix Wright which rely a lot on their music as cues would be so much better if played with decent sound. Not sure why but the music in this emulator plays awkwardly slow and off-beat. It's really choppy.,April 13 2016,4,1468

The only issue I have is that occasionally the game will crash when you reach 100%(like when you're entering a new location and loading) but luckily the emulator has an auto save feature  and also just make sure you save before entering a new area in case the emulator crashes. It took a few minutes to figure out the saving features  make sure you go to loaded games and avoid using quick save as well since it's a bit more reliable.,April 07 2016,4,1468

One thing that the issue with me is the menu of the emulator wont work. Im using a Galaxy S6 Edge  i dont know if this is a common thing but i guess you could say the overall experience as i cannot change any settings / access the main emulator menu etc. If this is fixed  i will ABSOLUTELY change the review to 5*. Like i said  gameplay is pretty much faultless  just the menu issue...,March 07 2016,4,1468

7cbc1059-afc9-11e6-abc9-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,This is a wonderful app  and works far better than one would think being free. The devs came up with a simple solution for the lower screen it can be switched between controls and screen by pressing a button. There is a problem where games animation will be slower on all but the simpliest games  but it is updated fairly regularly so it is running far better than when it first launched. So I can see it dissapearing in a year or two. Beyond that everything else works wonderful.,February 27 2016,4,1468

I play without sound and it barely lags. It does crash occasionally  but it autosaves  so it's been a relative non-issue for me. I'd recommend this app to a friend. The best part is that it's free.

Considering so few have managed to develop decent Nintendo DS series emulators - on smartphones/tablets OR computers - this is actually a pretty good effort! The interface is great and whilst there is a little bit of sluggishness  the most recent update ensures that most games are playable  even with the sound on (which doesn't seem to affect the performance too much). All that's needed is a little more tweaking for smoother gameplay and this would be perfect... I used Pok?mon Black for my testing.,February 12 2016,4,1468

7cbc5bee-afc9-11e6-a4b9-c4b301cdf627,com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Pretty awesome..missing two things Finds and opens nds files well. I assume no archive support as others were complaining...they should unarchive their roms before trying to play or rate your app low. It is missing the speed mods. And the quick savestate and quick load state are a poke fans bread and butter  having to press extra buttons to save state or load state is relatively tedious. If that could be added as soft buttons or as an option to add them as soft buttons then that would be it  it would be a 5 in my book. Thank you so much!,February 01 2016,4,1468

Years ago I made usability suggestions for this game and they appear to have all been implemented  making this soooo easy to play! Big kudos for that. Enjoyment is seriously hampered by gargantuan full screen click-through ads between each and every level. That's fine if I don't pay  but I *can't* pay to take them from a game I love.

7bdf647a-afc9-11e6-a0a0-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Thank you. Really is a fun  intuitive  and completely FREE app. I was going to give it 4 stars due to bugs  but since this app doesn't have any ads during gameplay and is entirely free  I can't say 'free' gets much better than this.

7bdf64fa-afc9-11e6-9db3-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Best of them all. I've tried several apps that play z-file games and this is by far the most intuitive and user friendly interpreter by a long shot. I'm not going to mark it down for not being able to handle glulx files because even now there are none that can. Twisty claims to be able to  but it doesn't work for me  at least not with the game I've tried anyway. This is a definite keeper. Very  very highly recommended.,January 13 2016,5,1651

7bdf7635-afc9-11e6-829a-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,"Great for newbies too! I'm relatively new to the world of IF  and this app has been a great introduction. It directs new users to some beginner (tutorial) stories  and makes it easy to find games that interest you. The only things I'd like to see changed are listing the score and day/time (in game) on the main screen while playing (as this is important in some games)  and correcting the issue of double enters with just one """"enter"""" press when using a bluetooth keyboard. I found a temporary fix for the latter issue by selecting the """"auto collapse keyboard"""" option under settings  but this makes it so I have to manually select the text entry field every time before typing - annoying  but better than the program interpreting one press of the enter button as two. Still  a great program with lots of potential. Thanks!",June 18 2015,4,1651

7bdf885e-afc9-11e6-be25-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Wonderful Can't say anything severe other than it feels like the site with the downloadable files could have more. I also had an issue with a couple not loading other than that  you can't beat text adventures.,March 08 2015,4,1651
7bdf8959-afc9-11e6-8b92-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Yay! Lots if fun. Great twists and unexpected a settings.,February 27 2015,5,1651
7bdf89d9-afc9-11e6-918a-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Excellent z interpreter Makes playing parser text adventures more fun. The intuitive UI saves a lot of typing to create fluid game play. The accompanying website is clear making it easy to choose interactive fictions. Highly recommended.,February 25 2015,5,1651
7bdf8a5e-afc9-11e6-bc3c-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Outstanding Now someone needs to make an app that allows you to create stories to play for this app.,February 20 2015,5,1651
7bdf8ae1-afc9-11e6-abaf-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Great app. Nice and clean. Easy to use.,February 19 2015,5,1651

7bdf8d38-afc9-11e6-a462-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,EXCELLENT Z Interpreter! This is the BEST interactve-text shell program I've run across that is for Android. It is fast  responsive  intuitive and makes interactive fiction that much more fun because of one-key entries and icon selection actions. You don't even have to use the keyboard for most of your action commands. It is a very well thought out format and game-play method and allows you to just focus on the game. Excellent app that I would recommend to anyone.,January 24 2015,5,1651
7bdf8dba-afc9-11e6-8fa1-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Great! Good interface  much nicer than having to type everything in.,January 23 2015,5,1651
7bdf8e3a-afc9-11e6-b9ae-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,The best I just hope it can play graphical versions too and a gblorb.. Coz i love this app that i dont want to use another app,January 23 2015,5,1651
7bdf8ebd-afc9-11e6-905d-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Great! I had thought twisty was the best on android  but I didn't try this yet. This is the best! Works marvellously for hhgg.,January 22 2015,5,1651
7bdf8f47-afc9-11e6-b5d2-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Amazing! As a huge fan of text-based games  this really is like hitting the jackpot! Wide game selection  easy to use and SO much fun  plus most games have a large amount of replay value! Only wish I could save my games  but that's not a huge issue for me. All in all  this was a very well-made app that is totally worth getting!,January 17 2015,5,1651
7bdf8fcc-afc9-11e6-9236-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Amazing The best interactive fiction reader out there. Can't wait for more extension support!,January 14 2015,5,1651
7bdf904f-afc9-11e6-b33a-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,"Really great z interpreter!!! Easily the cleanest and most responsive I've seen  the smart interface takes a little of the tedium out of the command line only interface. Love it!! I only have one issue: When I use my wireless Logitech 920 keyboard over bluetooth  for some reason every time I hit enter  it issues 2 enter commands. As a result  the engine first interprets my command  and then an empty green bubble appears  to which the interpreter responds  """"I beg your pardon?"""" If that little fix could be made  it would be wonderful! Great product!!",January 09 2015,5,1651
7bdf90d9-afc9-11e6-8e91-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Very good interpreter. This is the way it is done My only gripe is that it chokes on some games. Most will at least run from IF archive though,January 09 2015,5,1651
7bdf9170-afc9-11e6-826b-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Best so far for Android Fast and intuitive UI has now replaced JFrotz on my phone. Layout is obviously designed to appeal to younger generation although I use fullscreen 'Jason' theme to save screen space. Download of new stories is easier than other interpreters too. No support for coloured text though e.g. in Photopia. Otherwise great.,January 03 2015,5,1651
7bdf91fd-afc9-11e6-958c-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Fantastic Would love to see glulxe supported.,December 30 2014,5,1651
7bdf9287-afc9-11e6-9fc5-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,"Best I've found so far Definitely the best Android z-machine interpreter I've found. The only possible drawback is that the """"text message"""" look might inhibit some games that played with formatting (I.e. ascii art  status bar stuff  etc) but I honestly haven't even encountered this as a problem yet -- just something to consider for the future perhaps. And it'd be worth it just to have such a smooth interpreter 99% of the time. The rest are all buggy or the keyboard gets in the way so much you can't even read.",December 27 2014,5,1651
7bdf934f-afc9-11e6-b483-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Great app It's really great emulator for Text based games. It works smoothly and the interface is simple.,December 27 2014,5,1651
7bdf93e3-afc9-11e6-84c4-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,One of the best I have found I love the old school text adventures and have pretty much everything Infocom ever released. This is definitely the best interpreter I have found for the tablet.,December 26 2014,5,1651

7bdf94e8-afc9-11e6-97da-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Really well presented text adventure app I was looking to play a text adventure and came across this little gem! Great web support and simple interface. Merits 5 stars because not only does it do what it should do  but it does it nicely!,December 14 2014,5,1651
7bdf956b-afc9-11e6-8423-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Great! A very simple to use app. But is there a way to implement glulx into it? (In reply to your comment  it would be better than not having any glulx supported apps in the store),December 13 2014,5,1651
7bdf95e3-afc9-11e6-a021-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Worth downloading Really good interface and some good layout options have been added. Look forward to the day when Glulxe is added.,December 06 2014,5,1651
7bdf9666-afc9-11e6-9c39-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,As good as it can get Difficult as it is to play IF on a phone  I can't imagine a much better phone app for this.,December 06 2014,5,1651
7bdf976b-afc9-11e6-ae4f-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Great! Needs Glulx and TADS support  through.,November 30 2014,5,1651
7bdf97eb-afc9-11e6-92e2-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Brilliant Amazing implementation of a z-machine interpreter. I was pretty skeptical until I actually used the app  but the intuitive input system works amazingly well.,November 30 2014,5,1651
7bdf9863-afc9-11e6-93e7-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,The great UI makes it possible to play without a physical keyboard. The only thing it lacks is Glulxe/gblorb support.,November 29 2014,5,1651
7bdf9968-afc9-11e6-b5f1-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Well designed  but it would be desirable for it to read gblorb files.,November 07 2014,4,1651
7bdf99e8-afc9-11e6-a0ed-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Awesome layout I've seen only a few for pc  but this one has a amazing layout. Having more fun than ever with it. My only problem is that I didn't find too much games on website  maybe it's because the type is old and almost nobody create these types of games. Can I download games from other websites? What is the game format for this one?,November 04 2014,4,1651
