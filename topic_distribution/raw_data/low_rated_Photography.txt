I generally liked this app ..but gave up on it because it stops focusing (on anything) after about 30 seconds of video is recorded. After a certain amount of time  touching anywhere on the screen shows the focusing square [ ] but it still stays out of focus. It doesnt even attempt to lock on to anything. This only happens in video. Ive notified the developer but never received a reply. Its a shame because I liked this..oh yeah  updates never fixed it.,September 14 2016,1,290

Now that I have switched to an Android phone (LG V20)  I find it less than stellar. Principally  this is due to Adobe forcing me to sign in to an Adobe account in order to utilize certain features. On my Lumia  these same features were an add-on purchase. I don't have an Adobe account  nor will I create one  so I won't be signing in.

3380d0b0-e00f-11e6-8f37-fa163e345ce9,com.hp.android.print,Junk. Okay  I figured out how to get it to print again  randomly. It may not be all their server. It might be updates making older printers obsolete. You just have to buy a new printer. (Along with setting things up for this app. But I didn't have to disconnect the computer's USB cable like the online help said to.) Don't try to use Wi-Fi direct (that was just an experiment)  even if you don't think you need an internet connection. Use your mobile hotspot. Wi-Fi Direct just disables the printer from being able to print over a USB cable from a PC  even after you turn Wi-Fi Direct off. But whether it works or not  or prints correctly  is a random event...as usual. As before  if you want to print webpages  get Microtech's eprint. The 10/6/2016 version automatically turns my phone's WiFi on for no reason. I have to say that asking me to look at a screen full of thumbnails to tell it which picture to print is really boneheaded. How about a list of FILE NAMES?!!!!! (Idjuts!),December 12 2016,1,1883

d8bb9f2d-ec42-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.venticake.retrica,The image quality is very poor. It reduces my 12 MP phone camera to 2MP on the high quality setting! Why would any camera app do that? And being asked to save a photo after every shot is clunky and irritating when you are trying to shoot action. When I looked on the internet to find a solution it advised that my Android might have memory capacity issues  even though Im using a brand new One Plus 3t. I'm a photographer and image quality is important to me for image editing shots. Until the developers fix this problem  avoid this app. It's ruined some great shots with terrible reduction in quality.,February 04 2017,1,1930

c137f597-df4b-11e6-8f37-fa163e345ce9,fr.xplod.focal,sadly my review is inaccurate because the star system has no context. I actually like this app and its very easy to use but it appears to be significantly flawed that prevents it from working correctly outside its custom ROM. I have a G S4  I had a compatible [CyanogenMod] G S4 that I had to replace and now I'm stuck with TouchWiz. While Focal works brilliantly on CYM it is buggy at best on anything else. I had very little successes even getting the app to run much less take pictures. on CYM it takes very good pictures and is very easy to use  which is why I downloaded it after I was forced to replace my device  unfortunately its not ready for mass consumption just yet. I have tried a number of approach to the problem and nothing seems to solve it yet. it seems that the CYM team needs to figure out what the problem is and correct it. Unless you are rooted and can install this specific Custom Rom (which seems like a lot just for an app  good or not) I would not recommend wasting your time on this. it won't work  it might corrupt some other apps installed and it might have some unforeseen consequence on your storage (internal/external SD card) due to incompatibilities in the ROM,February 03 2016,2,1944

7e4eb85e-df4e-11e6-8f37-fa163e345ce9,fr.xplod.focal,Almost nothing works HDR never stitches the pictures as well as taking forever to actually snap them(2-3s(!) between each pic). Also all of them have the same exposure making it useless. Sphere finder is constantly rotating by itself  not showing progress of snapped pictures nor stitching them together but fills the gallery with them afterwards. Pointless since I couldn't see what I was shooting on the screen. For now ONLY works for regular pics  with sub-par quality. On the upside I like that you can pin stuff.
