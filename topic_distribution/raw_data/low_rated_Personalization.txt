7c55d7eb-afc9-11e6-a8f6-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,A lot of bugs. Good but not complete If your looking for a lockscreen this app is incomplete. In fact  it notes the lockscreen feature is still in beta testing so really this app is not doing its 1 job. Example: phone unlocks automatically without swiping and can be done by just a button. Sometimes even auto unlocks when a notification comes up. For the most part this app looks promising as it's clean and minimal. However it's like a video-game you buy which needs constant DLC to make it work.,August 02 2016,2,863

7c583cf5-afc9-11e6-ae49-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,I tried using this as a lock screen  but it had some problems. You can't set a separate wallpaper for it. You can't set custom shortcuts for unlock areas that aren't just dialer/camera (what about SMS? or a custom activity?). It doesn't seem to block the home button if you have your system lock screen disabled. If you *don't* disable your system lock screen  it takes about 5 seconds for AC display to appear when you wake up your phone. It doesn't report widget size to widgets  so many can't work properly.,December 03 2015,2,863

So other than date/time  I now get little out of the widget. Too bad.[/UPDATE] After trying a number of clock widgets  this one seems like a keeper. Only used it for a couple of hours  so don't know if there are other issues  but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap  when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3  and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly  if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS.,March 21 2016,2,1331

DashClock looks like a great and very useful app. Unfortunately  in spite of myself being a technogeek  installation is highly unintuitive and difficult  made even so when the different mobile device carriers are always changing the location of this command  that function. I would like to use this widget on my phone  but I will probably end up tossing it off my phone because it is too hard to set up (and I'm not one to give up that easy). I'd give it five stars but because of the installation issues  it deserves  at best  only two stars.,December 20 2014,2,1331

7bd5b7eb-afc9-11e6-b2cd-c4b301cdf627,com.umang.dashnotifier,This is an OK app but it does have two issues. The first one is... it does Not offer automatic rotational viewing. So in other words  on my Samsung phones the content is displayed in portrait mode when my phone is charging in landscape mode. From what I can gather Dashclock uses the display mode that your phone is last on when it activates. So if your Homescreen is able to rotate like on a tablet  then no problem. However  if you're using a phone and your homescreen locks at only portrait mode then when Dashclock starts while you're charging... everything will be displayed sideways. The only way around that would be to open up any app that rotates  like Gmail for instance...then Dashclock will be displayed properly if your phone is in landscape mode. I did that until I found a rotational app that rotates my homescreen only when it's plugged in. The second issue/bug I found is a biggie. When Dashclock is running  it disables the swipe down to show notifications. When I first discovered this bug I thought it was my phone... but the problem only occurs when Dashclock is activated during charge....,October 10 2015,2,1774
