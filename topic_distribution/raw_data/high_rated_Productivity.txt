Nice job  guys! ======================================================================================== Update: It seems tasks are laid out according to GMT  rather than local time  on the """"Due"""" tab (Today  Tomorrow  Next Days  Someday). Due dates display correctly in editing and on the server. This makes it a bit difficult to see what you've entered for Tomorrow  as it appears as Today  etc. There's also some inconsistency when dealing with subtasks. It seems there may be two or more standards for specifying them: one way wherein the subtask is entered as a new line in the Description field  and another using a more formal specification.

7c226aae-afc9-11e6-9ffe-c4b301cdf627,com.jefftharris.passwdsafe,Simple and effective Have been looking around and tried about 8 others with various problems from messy interfaces  obtrusive ads and various restrictions. This simple but effective app does the job. In the notes it states to download separate sync app (I didn't notice this at first) and once this is done you can store your password file on the major cloud bases such as Dropbox. Would be great to have the companion app either integrated or a link in the main app to prompt new users to download if sync required (just for slow people like me) Also  an idea possibly for future development... have a sync file for app preference settings (such as default symbols  timeout etc) so that it only has to be set once and will follow the pattern across several devices (optional use incase anyone prefers different settings on each device). Just an extra but no biggy to do it manually. Great work  thanks for developing.,July 24 2016,5,572

When searching for an entry  do live search/update/filtering after each keypress instead of requiring to finish the search input with a return key and then do the search.

7c62628a-afc9-11e6-88c1-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.remotekeyboard,Absolutely indispensable app to save hours of Your life! Simple  but impossible to live without once you try it. You missed one HUGE improvement though. The app is small so the best way to implement it is to let it sit in the background and switch the remote keyboard on when it receives a TELNET connection on port 2323. This way I could just telnet in and start typing instead of having to open the app and select the remote keyboard.,June 09 2016,5,651

7c626ae6-afc9-11e6-ae5c-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.remotekeyboard,This application actually works very well. It's nice to transfer my fast typing speed into fast phone typing. Plus I can set my phone up next to my computer and not have to worry about it. I only notice occasional blips of speed whereas the typing doesn't immediately get sent.

7c627f7a-afc9-11e6-8685-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.remotekeyboard,This is SUCH a useful app! I use it every day at work as well as at home. I've even included it in my startup batch script haha. Using the keyboard via USB is a little trickier than via WiFi as you have to enable debugging on your device and also have to use ADB to forward a port to 2323 from the computer  but this process is very easy to script as ADB is a command line tool. 5 stars because I haven't had a single problem with it yet!,July 08 2015,5,651

7c62845c-afc9-11e6-8f27-c4b301cdf627,de.onyxbits.remotekeyboard,Nice. Works great for the most part. I love the no-lag connection when using my PC keyboard to type in WhatsApp and the stock SMS app. The one drawback is navigation functionality  which could use some work... For example  I can use CTRL+Q to back out of a WhatsApp conversation  and then I can use up/down arrows to move around my current conversations  but there is no way to actually enter into a different conversation! With my stock SMS app  on the other hand  I can select a conversation from my list of current conversations and enter into any one with my keyboard ENTER key; i can then back out of that conversation using CTRL+Q  but at that point I'm completely frozen! Up/down doesn't work anymore  CTRL+Q doesn't work anymore...so I'm forced to pick up the phone again. Still the best remote keyboard app I've ever seen  though (: (I think step-by-step installation instructions would be helpful to those who have no experience using a telnet connection  by the way.),May 27 2015,4,651

It would be nice if a more secure option than telnet was utilised  but  when used on a private network this isn't a problem.

7bfe4fca-afc9-11e6-b2cf-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,The Best I tested many of the highly rated task managers  and this one has the most customization options available. Task creation is quick and simple  and it syncs with my Windows Mail calendar so no matter which device I'm using  my tasks are viewable. Great support also.,October 26 2016,5,783

7bfe51d1-afc9-11e6-80e1-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Best Task Manager I have tried many task managers and this one used to be the best until Yahoo destroyed this app... I am glad its back. Thank you Alex!,October 24 2016,5,783

7bfe5394-afc9-11e6-8d0c-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,The app works very well. But in the end I've decided it doesn't match my workflow well. I've used for a long time a simple text file to manage tasks  similar to markdown; the advantage is that I can create (long) notes in the same place  that I can create subtasks with arbitrary levels and that I can move tasks around between multiple sections: tasks to do today  tasks to do soon  long term tasks and completed tasks. I can also render that in a smaller font with compact lines to see more content.,October 17 2016,5,783
7bfe5466-afc9-11e6-a41b-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Tried them all I literally tested and compared almost a dozen google tasks compatible task apps  and this one is the best  and has a great widget! Love it!,October 17 2016,5,783
7bfe5573-afc9-11e6-8d80-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,A lot functionality in a small package. Best app,October 15 2016,5,783
7bfe55f5-afc9-11e6-b926-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,So much potential This has nearly every feature under the sun. Its Achilles' heel is there is no way to sync all the information pertaining to tasks across devices or at least automatically back it up to the likes of Drive or Dropbox. Although it can sync with Google tasks  it can't edit Google Task categories  and most information pertaining to tasks can't be synchronised and backup is strictly manual. Also  comments and timer logs on a tasks seemingly can't be deleted.,October 14 2016,4,783
7bfe5678-afc9-11e6-9f6e-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,The best one I tried many apps and this is most perfect. It's for people who need structure and flexibility combined.,October 13 2016,5,783

7bfe5800-afc9-11e6-9f46-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Unbelievably well thought-out with nearly all of the many subtle but important features that almost all other task apps  even the popular ones  do not have in completeness (have this but not that). To name a few of these features: due time (not just date)  high customize-ability in task-repetition  customize-able widget  past due tasks are still visible but signified  auto-sorting of tasks  tags  sticky notifications  ability to check off tasks in widget  and future tasks appearing only within a specified time before due date. The only thing missing for now is web-access/cloud synchronization for use on multiple platforms.,October 07 2016,5,783

7bfe5b00-afc9-11e6-92d8-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,I really like this app. I would love it more if it had a web based version that synced between my devices. Otherwise it's exactly what I need but I'm eyeing other apps that offer the functionality of a web page or desktop app.,September 27 2016,4,783
7bfe5b82-afc9-11e6-a7fb-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Working with it! I'm new at this. I hope it gets better and easier as I go.,September 25 2016,4,783

7bfe6173-afc9-11e6-9c94-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Very Good  but can't sort tasks Very easy to use and highly customizable. Synchronizes with Google Tasks. Easy on the eyes. One shortcoming: can't reorder tasks in the list by date or priority.,September 10 2016,4,783
7bfe61f3-afc9-11e6-b63b-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Really good Would love to have the colours appear in the widget and for the tasks to be sorted by Priority. Would also love a priority to be set as the default against an individual label / tag,September 10 2016,5,783

7bfe650a-afc9-11e6-9cdc-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Great app with an excellent widget Full featured tasks reminder.

7bfe6711-afc9-11e6-805e-c4b301cdf627,org.tasks,Simply WOW I've tested almost all the related apps and this one is by far the greatest. Love the in depth settings and the ways in which I can customize the widget. The only thing that I'm missing is having the date for each task on the right side of the title and not below (widget). It would look so much better. On a galaxy s6 the font for the date is very small on the widget  even at maximum size and it's very tiring to the eyes,August 25 2016,5,783

A feature I'd love to take it up to 5* are: A field of what year the book was first published. If I add an Ebook for example  it might have been published electronically in 2012 but was first published in the 80s. Having a field for both current edition publication date and year of first release would be excellent.,July 24 2016,4,866

I had an issue where I could see the pictures of my book images but that is all I could see. Long story short they went way out of their way to help resolve the issue.

This app is making it easy to avoid duplicate purchases and keep separate lists of what I have  what I want  and what my friends and family would like. The one thing I would change is the 'find other books in this series' feature. It goes through Amazon  which is not structured well to find what is missing. I would prefer something through the LoC or Mark Records  but I understand the developer is based out of Australia.,July 11 2016,5,866

Fully featured way to create and manage a collection of books; from quickly populating with found information (or creating your own book details) to locating your book and tracking activity related to it. NOTE: I have the same problem as many others with cover graphics not showing in detail view (fine in list and edit). Oddly  vertical graphics are all missing but horizontal are fine.

I've been a user of this app for quite a while now  have a catalogue of over 700 books registered  and it's been awesome  however  with the most recent update  something went wrong. The thumbnail of the book cover shows up on the book list  and on the edit page for each book  but on the book details page  it only shows a single white pixel in the place where the cover should be. Every book in my catalogue is like this now. Is there a fix for this? Or is it a bug in the new version?,June 19 2016,4,866

7cc35d57-afc9-11e6-acef-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Library organized in 3 hours! Inputting the ISBN number manually is no problem for me  the perks of this app completely outweigh that con. The only thing I would want  is to be able to add friends  so we can see what the other is missing. You know  for Christmas and birthdays and such. Oh  also to be able to see what books we are missing in a series without going out of the app  to amazon (where I do buy my books  but I'd rather stay in the app and have them organized). I've already recommended it to friends and family!,June 12 2016,4,866
7cc35e30-afc9-11e6-9ec3-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Great app Great for cataloguing my several thousands of books as they were unpacked.

Loved how it broke down authors by series! Definitely a favorite feature. Made trying to complete some of my random book series much simpler when visiting used book stores and garage sales. Unfortunately when I had to replace my broken phone  I lost my library. My uncle saved the files to computer  but couldn't get them to go into the new app download on new phone.

Don't bother looking for any other app  just get this one!,May 15 2016,5,866
7cc36851-afc9-11e6-9b13-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Almost perfect Love the auto retrieval of ISBN. I wish it can access external card. Also entering author manually has too many steps. Otherwise this is the perfect app for a personal library.,May 13 2016,4,866
7cc36970-afc9-11e6-9f54-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,This app is everything I was looking for  with one exception: I cannot successfully add already-catalogued books to bookshelves. I'm sure it's easy to do once you know how  but the FAQs does not cover it and there are no instructions. Perhaps you are supposed to add books directly to the desired bookshelf? If so  is there a way to move a book to a different shelf if you change your mind later? This app is still great  I'd change rating to 5 stars once clarification is provided.,May 10 2016,4,866
7cc369fd-afc9-11e6-8ee7-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,I am so pleased with the Book Catalogue. I read several books a month.

Scanning works flawlessly already added over 60 books. Like the intergration of LibraryThing  makes it a breeze to select the correct cover of your book  making it redundant to try to take a photo of your book. Only thing this app needs is better system for marking a book as read and even a tally of how many times you've read it.,April 27 2016,5,866

Once the cover art was different  but it gave me the choice to choose from other editions  and voila: there was mine. I also like that you can easily upload your own image and rotate it  if necessary. I work in a bookstore  so I have a lot of books in my personal collection: this is a godsend!

7cc36ed4-afc9-11e6-8d34-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Amazing! If you're a huge book collector like I am this is by far the best way to keep track of your collection. And the barcode scanner is amazing for those quick answers on what number in the series the book is  especially if you're a thrift store book hunter like I am. Hands down the best app I've downloaded. Love it!,April 22 2016,5,866
7cc36f61-afc9-11e6-8bc0-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Great app. Unlike the Goodreads app you can look at your library without any sort of internet  which is great. Not only that but you can import your Goodreads library. This app saved me from having to redo my entire library. Bit of a issue with the scanner crashing every once and awhile but other then that i have no complaints. Would definitely recommend this app to all book readers and collectors.,April 16 2016,5,866
7cc36ff8-afc9-11e6-bdcf-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Book Catalogue I have looked far and wide for an app like this. Awesome app very convenient and very quick.

Developers should consider doing the same app but for movies as I really like the layout.,April 15 2016,5,866
7cc3708f-afc9-11e6-aad0-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Perfect for cataloguing your library.

Look and feel is pretty dated  and have others have noted  it's a little too much work to transfer to a new phone (backup files  install app on new phone  move backup to new phone  import backup into app). Would be much easier if you could import/export to Google Drive,April 13 2016,4,866

I hate having duplicates of books or being in bookstores and not knowing what I need. I used to write down a list that had a legend it was so big  to keep track of what books I had to buy first and then read  which ones to read first  which ones I've loaned to my friends  which ones put on Amazon wish list   which ones I purchased & didn't cross off  or which ones I have pre-ordered.

7cc374c7-afc9-11e6-bae8-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Absolutely love it!! So I've had this app for a while and just started adding my books. I've added 96 so far with no real complaints. It's really straight forward and very easy to use. I love that it adds everything about the book after you scan it. I've had to search the internet for some which is not a big deal and also takes little time. But to do so  you need a LibraryThing account  slight con there and you have to download a different scanner. But overall still a great app and will stop me from buying more duplicates lol.,March 29 2016,5,866
7cc375e6-afc9-11e6-9b03-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Great App I have a poor memory and this is great.

Once I found the right scanner app (- this app doesn't recreate the wheel) If I can't figure something out  Evan responds to email w/in 48 hrs! Saves me from buying duplicate books because I simply cannot remember titles of &gt;2k books.

It won't scan and look up ISSN and is not able to look up books through UPC code  only ISBN. Not sure if ISMN is supported  but considering that most music is in electronic form these days as well as many CDs don't have the ISMN as a barcode it's not something that I would miss if it's not implemented.,February 06 2016,4,866

7cc3889c-afc9-11e6-9b05-c4b301cdf627,com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Like the app. overall. I've already added over 80 books with many  many more to go. A couple of issues  though. 1. There are too many steps to check off that you have read a book - select the book  select the edit icon  select notes  select that you've read it  then select save. Given that marking a book as read is a common occurrence  it seems like marking a book as read would be easier. 2. When I try to scan Barcode/ISBNs  sometimes it tells me that the ISBN is invalid  but when I enter the ISBN manually  the book is found. Beyond those two issues  though  I like the software and am looking forward to finally getting my library cataloged. Update: Since this upgraded to version 5.2.0 - It hasn't gotten any better about scanning the ISBN. Half the time it doesn't find it until I key it in manually. Also  it seems to take longer now to find the book after the ISBN is entered.,January 30 2016,4,866

I sometimes have to turn off the WiFi to get the book to show up because some book stores are either too slow or maybe don't allow. Either way I can just turn it off and it works fine. It also allows you to move books from Wanted to My Books fairly easy when you get that book.,January 27 2016,5,866

A couple of features that would top this app off would be the ability to have it also show all the books in a series (for example) to make it easier for people to see what books they may be missing when trying to complete a set. It would then also need to have a check box to indicate if the book is in the library or not  and having the app automatically offer to complete the series when a book is scanned in would be grand.,January 08 2016,5,866

For FREE(!) this app is beyond all expectations. I have over 1300 books in it. the ability to sync to good reads (at least receive from  believe send to is broken)  cross reference with library things  keep track of loans to people  and backup reminders (and the backups work!) are an amazing value. Let me explain the basic process. 1.) Download this app and good reads app 2.) link to goodreads and librarythings 3.) Open good reads and use their UPC scanner to scan in everything you own indiscriminately. Try to organize on teh good reads side if you feel inclined. 4.) Sync from good reads (one way  if send is still broken) - all books  their covers  synopsis  page count - all data is now in book catalogue. You can search by auther  borrowed  and more. Saves me from re-buying books - since 1300 is a little hard to keep track of. Furthermore  unlike the good reads app - this works offline. I can also give a copy to friends if they want to borrow they have a copy of my database. My favorite android app - yes  synergy between others  but the developer did it!,September 14 2015,5,866

Also  when I search for a specific book by typing in the exact title and author  it will sometimes come up with a different book entirely sometimes not even the authors match so I'll have to go online to find the ISBN #. But that's only if I'm unable to scan the book itself. Another BIG also  there should be an option to catalog e-books. The only options in the details are hard copies.

There's an option to export the data of your books  in case you need all your information on your computer. One thing I would mention  once you put a book to one bookshelf  I don't think that there is an easy way of moving it to an other bookshelf in the app like scanning it on another bookshelf. It supports a few scanner apps  from which google googles is the best  but I'd be happier if i-nigma was supported as it's very fast  or if I could add books by importing the ISBNs. Also it's a shame only barcodes can be scanned and not ISBN numbers. (some books don't have a bar code).,March 02 2014,4,866

Functionality was exactly what I needed. Interface was reasonably intuitive (to an android/touch screen newbie!). A key requirement was to be able to export/import book data. This was achievable by means of a file management application (to get the file back onto the Nexus  which has no micro SD card) and an appropriately formatted CSV file. Note that Excel cannot format the file correctly  but LibreCalc can. Only thing I couldn't fathom out was how to get the same book onto multiple shelves.

But the major change has to be do is that the floating shortcut doesn't appeare as soon as text is been coppied on clipboard and the thing which has to be done is firstly we have to pull down the notification tray and then after putting it back the floating shortcut appeares and also the bubble short cut is insecure while using banking apps so I would rate app as 5 star only when you people will develop an app of such a form that app will not ask acesseblity permission.,May 02 2016,4,926

7c9bd5b8-afc9-11e6-9fcb-c4b301cdf627,com.catchingnow.tinyclipboardmanager,Nice and simple! Not loaded with useless features. I really love this app its exactlly what I need. Except for one thing you can backup you your clipboard but there has to be a better way to sync it with all your devices. Maybe some type of cloud sync.

7c9bde51-afc9-11e6-95ea-c4b301cdf627,com.catchingnow.tinyclipboardmanager,Useful However  it still needs some basic features  such as: (1) a filter or separate list to show only the starred (favourite) entries  and (2) a way to change their sort order e.g. Alphabetical or reverse chronological  plus (3) one button exporting ALL captured entries to a text file (currently you have to select them one by one or set a time period). A more technically challenging improvement would be an option to call up Clip Stack when we tap on 'paste' instead of just pasting what's on the clipboard.,July 23 2015,4,926

7c9be0f0-afc9-11e6-8f68-c4b301cdf627,com.catchingnow.tinyclipboardmanager,An excellent lightweight clipboard manager which uses minimal system resources. I especially like the floating bubble which means no swapping between apps to find and insert the clips  unlike the others I tried.

The only feature I would really like to see added is a way to reorder the clips.,July 15 2015,5,926

7bd1c002-afc9-11e6-8e11-c4b301cdf627,org.tomdroid,"White white white  my poor eyes ;-).. would there be a dark theme around  please? I'm not even talking about encrypting notes or a widget for notes (the links are already a good start).. Apart from this  a full-featured app  look'n'feel  usuability  lighweight and sync are appreciated. BTW  Tomdroid cannot send text/file to Samsung Memo nor receive from it. Sharing both ways works w/ MPE Notes and this is good for MPE sync'ing (even if indirectly). Nota: a little bug w/ 0.7.5: if you delete all your notes  the main window will show """"Please wait while the notes load...""""  which is obviously wrong since there is no load process running. After a restart  it shows the expected """"There are no notes in Tomdroid's database"""".",August 30 2016,4,1125
7bd1c19c-afc9-11e6-a650-c4b301cdf627,org.tomdroid,Need Improvement Great in syncronize. Stable. Nothing to worry about. But  please add ability to insert objects  map coordinates for example. And also put undo in edititing notes mode.,August 04 2016,5,1125

7bd1d114-afc9-11e6-83e1-c4b301cdf627,org.tomdroid,Nice app but little disappointed Creates notes well. But syncs from its single folder. So when syncing it reads notes but not notebooks. That makes it incomplete as the main purpose is using it with Tomboy notes from Linux. Please make this happen :) Update: as reported in launchpad this will be a feature in the next 0.8 release.,March 06 2014,4,1125
7bd1d199-afc9-11e6-893f-c4b301cdf627,org.tomdroid,Getting much better - keep it up! As a longtime user of tomboy on Linux I need to have easy access on my Nexus Tablet. This now almost does it all.

7c19e9ba-afc9-11e6-908f-c4b301cdf627,org.openintents.filemanager,A nice  little  lightweight file manager. The app has a simple 'no-frills' design  and is ad-free  permission-lite and open source. It's designed for smartphones  though it might also be good on a phablet. Unsurprisingly  it would be rather basic for tablet use  unless you're the kind of user that prefers their apps spartan and minimalistic. Definitely worth taking for a spin.,June 14 2014,5,1203

E.g. if I want to hide 'Party at Claires' the filter excludes any item with """"party""""  """"at"""" and """"Claires"""" so would exclude items such as 'party at Johns' or 'leaving party'.

I used many habit tracker apps so I just have a few suggestions of little features to the badass who develop this app : 1. An extra option/buttons to select a custom color for the habit  2. A little less transparency in the """"check in"""" widget. Sometimes it's really hard to read what's written in the widget and 3. Option to select which days of the week the habit will be done.

7c704273-afc9-11e6-9ebf-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,Simple and to the point I just needed something to track habits per day and to be able to view it over a calendar period  with some simple yet informative analytics thrown in. This app does just that with no ads! This app is a win. One request to the developer is to include some form of sync / data backup (Android supports this natively now). I always find and feel that exporting backups to csvs and importing them back can be a bit of a risk as it only takes one forgetful moment and bam  data gone goodbye. Keep up the good work,October 27 2016,4,1427

I am pleased that so many of several days can be set as targets. Additionally  under custom  I was hoping to see where specific days of the week could be selected? Would this be difficult to add? For example  I'd like to see a task set for M-F and another task for Sunday  for instance. In the current design  I can select a certain # of days/week  but not which specific days.

7c7115e6-afc9-11e6-a445-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,The best app I ever had Simply great!!! Exactly what I needed. Lots of helpful widgets which I never before seen in any app. Separate widgets for separate habits/ tasks. You can check done/ not done on screen itself...and it changes the color when marked as done.... Great app..anyone who lacks in time management and priority management should have this app,August 02 2016,5,1427

7c711968-afc9-11e6-a8d8-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,Good  don't be like most... Most Apps stop being great because they forget why they started and become greedy. Asking for donations when in need of compesation while still maintaining an Ad-free experience will ensure you keep your users happy. Most users have had unpleasant experiences enough to the extent they can stop a great App when they see it and become loyal to it. Keep up the great work!,July 31 2016,5,1427

It's simple to use with a beautifully designed interface. I love the 1x1 widget  which can be used to create beautiful widget pages full of your tracked tasks. The simple tweaks like hold-tap to prevent accidental clicks are definitely appreciated as well. To top it all off  it's ad-free and open source! Well maintained open source applications like this deserve a lot of respect and appreciation.,July 30 2016,5,1427

A little suggestion as a feature request which I felt was missing. When you ask for a reminder and a question for the habit  on the same screen  you can also add a field that asks time for the remainder  like at the starting of the day it will remind me that so and so habits are to be fulfilled today and at defined time(which is currently present) it will ask for question whether you have been successful today with it.,July 21 2016,5,1427

7c714d4a-afc9-11e6-a756-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,Practically the best there is Loving the pure black night mode theme. Multiple occurrences and reminders per day are needed  though  and so are widgets for all habits  not just individual ones. It'd be nice if more days could be squeezed into portrait mode  too. Adding daily quotes like in Rewire (and other apps) would also be great. Most importantly  keep up the great work! The intuitivness and user friendliness of your app is way beyond most.,July 08 2016,4,1427

7c7154de-afc9-11e6-bc05-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,Request + Thanks Thank you  just started using but the app looks streamless. One request would be to make a widget where you can expand the app to a full or half screen so that my habits are the first thing I see when looking at my phone without having to click on the app to open  much like how calendar has it so you can view a half screen of what your dailey schedule looks like without having to open the app. Best regards!,July 05 2016,5,1427

The developer did a really good job and it's continually being updated and improved.,July 04 2016,5,1427
7c715811-afc9-11e6-affd-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,Thanks for the great app!! More features would make it perfect .. I liked the app but I think you need to add some options that would make it perfect like the ability to change the day the week starts with  or you should make a section for rewads which users can add to encourage themselves  also making targets would be a great idea  you can add more themes ... but in all I am surprised to see that it has only 100k downloads ... I would give it more than 5 stars if you could add these options ðŸ˜‰ keep up the good work ðŸ‘Œ?ðŸ˜‰,July 03 2016,4,1427

7c715917-afc9-11e6-9cbc-c4b301cdf627,org.isoron.uhabits,Life changer. Love this app. Have been using it for a month. I drive myself to continue with a habit  just so that I can tick the check mark and visibly look at each habit's rising consistency. The widgets are a functional addition and good looking too. Only missing feature is app sync across devices  but that isn't enough to deprive it off a five star rating.,July 03 2016,5,1427

The details available in each task are also awesome (graphs  calendars..). But I'd love to see something that other habit apps have. The ability to set *multiple reminders* per day  for things people have to do more times a day. Another thing I'd love is number input: besides the elegant ticks for completed tasks  I'd love if tasks could be 'yes/no' or 'number' type - eg. for 'eat X vegs' or 'run X kilometers this week' :),July 02 2016,4,1427

After having developed my own system for tracking routines  habits  projects  planning  etc  on a paper planner (and was learning how to make an app exclusively for my system)  I come across this AWESOME App. I have no need to look any further. THIS APP IS PERFECT FOR MY SYSTEM!!! I look forward to any and all upgrades coming. Now for a few ideas that immediately popped in my brain... LoL I WOULD TRIPLE LOVE IT IF... #1) There could be the possibility to have a computer software to sync with LoopHabitTracker for faster input. I WOULD QUADRUPLE LOVE IT IF... #2) I could have the ability to categorize the/a list and open a different tab for different lists  when working on specific projects  routines  etc that I may want to expand/itemize.

7c83a51c-afc9-11e6-81a7-c4b301cdf627,com.gh4a,Excellent ! High quality github client. So easy to bookmark repos and contributors  and so easy to download repos. It would be good if you could filter repos by language  e.g. Java. As this info is already displayed with each repo  I'm surprised it's not already one of the filters. It would make a big difference to repo browsing. Hitting the back button doesn't always take you back through your viewing history  e.g. from a repo back to your search results  so you have to search again. Still a great app though. v.useful,October 24 2016,5,1664
