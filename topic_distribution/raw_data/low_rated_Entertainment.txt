2b3094c4-e6b2-11e6-b6fc-fa163e345ce9,com.google.android.play.games,Google should notify us about their problems. Some or all games are affected with  Lagging  Freezes  Hard to chat  when keyboard went down  etc. I'm not alone. I think the game app might not be their fault but Google game play services fault.

I thought it was Google Play  because the phones that I bought were upgrades from  and  abandoning Apple products in favor of an LG-V10 and an LG-V20. Since I am still having problems with my games loading slow and crashing  I am updating this review yet again. Games still work fine on my Apple  but because of Android  or Google Play  they still keep loading slow and crashing and shave to always reload the games.

This app kept insisting that I give Google Play services access to my microphone  camera  body sensors  contacts  phone  SMS  EVERY permission possible before it would let me access my games. If you turn off permissions for even one thing  like body sensors  it will deny you access to your games. Really? Exactly how and why do you need to know my heart rate and oxygen level (my phone measures these) so that I can play a simple app like Sim City? Why would you want to be able to see and hear what I am doing anyway? I am not using any games that involve these. This is *very* intrusive. It doesn't really enhance gameplay anyway. It is one way to log in (there are others)  and gives you silly points and achiements that do nothing. I believe you can capture your gameplay. But at what cost? Google  please ask yourself why you are even asking for such intrustive permissions  let alone requiring them. This is sketchy as hell.,February 06 2017,1,1874

It deletes accounts upon install and in some cases may cause problems with functionality. If your able to root devices and this pre installed and remove it  use caution doing this. As a factory Google app (for some devices) this may damage the device. At one point when I was removing (with root permission) on a older device rendered it useless.

The cheapest pack on Slam is 7 500  and the odds are all ridiculously high. Even worse  for their divas set  they let the cards roll over so you waste 10k/pack to get a week 1 card when you were hunting week 9. Skip this one.
