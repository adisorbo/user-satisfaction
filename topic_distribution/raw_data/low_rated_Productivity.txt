Installed settings icon but no calendar widget even though settings are set to my default calendar. I can't recall how I got widget itself to appear on phone and I'm hardly a mobile device illiterate. Something is wrong when you create an app that doesn't make obvious how to activate full widget. Uninstalled. Waste of space unless you know how to unlock the magic key to get widget itself to appear on screen.
